==History==
There is an archaeological site located in Bagh called [[Bagh Fort]].<ref>[http://www.pmajk.gov.pk/history.asp#area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209052906/http://www.pmajk.gov.pk/history.asp |date=2011-02-09 }}</ref>

Prior to 1947, Bagh was a tehsil in the [[History of Poonch District|Poonch district]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]].<ref>{{citation |last=Snedden |first=Christopher |title=Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5KMCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR21 |year=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-1-84904-342-7 |page=xxi}}</ref>

Topographically, the entire Bagh district is a mountainous area, generally sloping from northeast to south-west. The area falls in the lesser Himalayas zone. The main range in the district is Pir-Panjal.

The Haji-Pir Pass is situated at the height of 3421 meters above sea level. The general elevation is between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The mountains are generally covered with coniferous forests. Mahl Nala (in the Bagh sub-division) and Betar Nala (in the Haveli sub-division) are the two main streams. However, numerous other rivulets flow in the district.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web |url=http://www.erra.pk/Reports/KMC/BaghProfile200907.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001853/http://www.erra.pk/Reports/KMC/BaghProfile200907.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The major language of Azad Kashmir is [[Pahari (Pothwari)|Pahari]]. The Pahari dialect spoken in Bagh is closely related to the dialect spoken to the north in [[Muzaffarabad District|Muzaffarabad]] (84% shared basic vocabulary) and with the core Pahari varieties spoken to the south(west) in the [[Galyat]] region around [[Murree]] (86–88%).<ref>{{Cite report| last1 = Lothers| first1 = Michael| last2 = Lothers| first2 = Laura| date = 2010| title = Pahari and Pothwari: a sociolinguistic survey| series = SIL Electronic Survey Reports| volume =  2010-012| url = https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/9130| p = 24}} The wordlist for these comparisons was collected in [[Neela Butt]].</ref>

== Education ==
According to [[Pakistan District Education Rankings|Pakistan District Education Ranking]] 2017, a report by [[Alif Ailaan]], the district of Bagh is ranked at number 5 nationally in the ranking related to education, with an education score of 73.99. The learning score is at 85.42 and gender parity score of 88.32.<ref name="alifailaan">{{cite web |title=Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017 |url=https://elections.alifailaan.pk/wp-includes/file/DER17.pdf |website=elections.alifailaan.pk |publisher=[[Alif Ailaan]] |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>

The school infrastructure score of Bagh is 28.32, giving Bagh a national rank of 126.<ref name="alifailaan" /> School infrastructure is a major problem in all of Kashmir. Access to schools, schools being far away is also a reason why there are fewer enrollments, especially after completing primary school.
