Topographically, the entire Bagh district is a mountainous area, generally sloping from northeast to south-west. The area falls in the lesser Himalayas zone. The main range in the district is Pir-Panjal.

The Haji-Pir Pass is situated at the height of 3421 meters above sea level. The general elevation is between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The mountains are generally covered with coniferous forests. Mahl Nala (in the Bagh sub-division) and Betar Nala (in the Haveli sub-division) are the two main streams. However, numerous other rivulets flow in the district.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web |url=http://www.erra.pk/Reports/KMC/BaghProfile200907.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001853/http://www.erra.pk/Reports/KMC/BaghProfile200907.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The climate of the district varies with altitude. The temperature generally remains between 2&nbsp;°C to 40&nbsp;°C. The main eastern part of the district is very cold in winter and moderate in summer. However, the lower valleys, the localities bordering Bagh at Kohala and its adjoining areas (Mongbajri and Ajra-Bagh) remain cold in winter and hot in summer. May, June and July are the hottest months. Maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of June are about 40&nbsp;°C and 22&nbsp;°C respectively. December, January and February are the coldest months. The maximum temperature in January is about 16&nbsp;°C and minimum temperature is 3&nbsp;°C respectively.

The learning score is at 85.42 and gender parity score of 88.32.<ref name="alifailaan">{{cite web |title=Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017 |url=https://elections.alifailaan.pk/wp-includes/file/DER17.pdf |website=elections.alifailaan.pk |publisher=[[Alif Ailaan]] |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>

The school infrastructure score of Bagh is 28.32, giving Bagh a national rank of 126.<ref name="alifailaan" /> School infrastructure is a major problem in all of Kashmir. Access to schools, schools being far away is also a reason why there are fewer enrollments, especially after completing primary school.
