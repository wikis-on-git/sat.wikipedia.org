He is a 'cry baby', fat and a loser as claimed by his friend Ryan. His family is poor and he is in [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]] for them. His sister is not getting married as he does not have enough [[dowry]] to give the groom's family. In the start of the story he dislikes Ryan as he is always having fun and not studying but, after he comes back after breaking friendship with Ryan and Hari, his perspective about Ryan changes. Alok is played by [[Sharman Joshi]] as Raju Rastogi in the movie ''3 Idiots'' and by [[Jiiva]] in ''Nanban''.

Despite its commercial success, the book was universally panned by contemporary book critics in India, with some calling it 'fast food literature'. Many discarded it as 'Bollywood on paper' referring to its over the top nature.

Before the release of the film, director [[Rajkumar Hirani]] commented on the relationship between ''Five Point Someone'' and ''3 Idiots'' stating:
:Chetan gave me this book to read and I wanted to make a film on it. But I knew right from the start that I could not make a film completely on the book, as it was very anecdotal and a film needs a plot. So I had decided to rewrite it in a screenplay format. You'll see that the film is very different from the book. After I wrote the script, I called Chetan and narrated it to him. I told him that if he did not like the script, I would stop the project. But he was okay with it.<ref>[http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/dec/23/slide-show-1-rajkumar-hirani-on-3idiots.htm#contentTop "Aamir's dedication is mistaken as interference"], Rediff.com, 23 December 2009.</ref>

The day after the film opened, Chetan also noted:
:Initially I did sit down with Raju and Abhijat while they were deciding to make a film based on 'Five Point Someone'. I even went to IIT with Abhijat a couple of times. But it was just not possible for me to be involved at every stage of the screenplay writing process since I was in Hong Kong at that time, working full-time and busy writing other books. Moreover, Abhijat is based in USA, Raju was in the US for quite a while working on the screenplay but it was not practical for me to do that [...] The film retains the soul of the book. ''3 Idiots'' is different from the book but at the same time it does borrow many things from the book. The core theme and message of the film is coming from the book itself. And that's why the makers have officially credited the film as 'Based on a novel by Chetan Bhagat.'<ref name=Bhagatint>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/interviews/2009/chetan-bhagat-interview-261209.html "3 Idiots retains the soul of Five Point Someone"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217224552/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/interviews/2009/chetan-bhagat-interview-261209.html |date=17 February 2013 }}, Chetan Bhagat interview, ''One India''.</ref>

A controversy developed a few days after the release, however, over the fact that Chetan's credit, "Based on the novel ''Five Point Someone'' by Chetan Bhagat" appeared in the closing credits rather than in the opening ones.<ref name=akinterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.glamsham.com/movies/interviews/02-aamir-khan-interview-011005.asp |title=Interview:Aamir Khan |publisher=GlamSham |accessdate=5 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308111215/http://www.glamsham.com/movies/interviews/02-aamir-khan-interview-011005.asp |archivedate=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At that time, Bhagat stated that he "was expecting an opening credit and I was quite surprised on not seeing it. They had bought the rights, made the payment and committed to a credit in the contract. It’s there, but it’s not about it being there, it’s about the placement and the prominence."<ref>Sharma, Neha.[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Chetan-Bhagat-feeling-cheated/H1-Article1-491135.aspx "Chetan Bhagat feeling cheated?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225125702/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Chetan-Bhagat-feeling-cheated/H1-Article1-491135.aspx |date=25 February 2010 }}, ''Hindustan Times'', 27 December 2009.</ref> In a 31 December 2009 blog post on his personal website, Bhagat stated that he was told the movie was only 2–5% based on the book, but when he saw it, he felt that it was 70% of the book. He also argued that he was misled by the makers of the film, though he noted, that "this has nothing to do with Mr. Aamir Khan [...] I am a big fan of Aamir and he has made my story reach people. However, he was told by the makers not to read the book, and he hasn’t. Thus, he cannot comment on the issue in a meaningful manner"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chetanbhagat.com/blog/general/a-book-a-film-and-the-truth |title=A book, a film and the truth |access-date=6 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225052408/http://www.chetanbhagat.com/blog/general/a-book-a-film-and-the-truth |archive-date=25 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A few people responded to Chetan's statements. According to the [[Indo-Asian News Service]] (IANS), during a press conference with reporters producer [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] "clarified that in the agreement between the producer and Bhagat, it was clearly mentioned that the author’s name would be put in the closing credits." IANS also reported that Chopra "lost his cool" and "asked a reporter to shut up after being questioned whether his hit ''3 Idiots'' was lifted from author Chetan Bhagat’s book ''Five Point Someone.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/vidhu-vinod-chopra-loses-cool-over-3-idiots-credit-row-lead_100297690.html|title=Vidhu Vinod Chopra loses cool over '3 Idiots' credit row (Lead)|date=1 January 2010}}</ref> Chopra later apologised, stating: "I really think I’m silly. I was provoked, but I shouldn’t have done this. I saw myself on TV and saw how I was shouting ‘shut up, shut up’ like an animal. I told myself — ‘what nonsensical behavior’."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-03/india/28134698_1_chetan-bhagat-vidhu-vinod-chopra-idiots|title=Vidhu apologises, Hirani flaunts pact with Chetan|agency=TNN|work=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref> [[Aamir Khan]] also responded to these claims.<ref name=akinterview/><ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_upset-aamir-khan-hits-out-at-novelist-chetan-bhagat_1329677 Upset Aamir Khan hits out at novelist Chetan Bhagat].
