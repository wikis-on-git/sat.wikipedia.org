He is a 'cry baby', fat and a loser as claimed by his friend Ryan. His family is poor and he is in [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]] for them. His sister is not getting married as he does not have enough [[dowry]] to give the groom's family. In the start of the story he dislikes Ryan as he is always having fun and not studying but, after he comes back after breaking friendship with Ryan and Hari, his perspective about Ryan changes. Alok is played by [[Sharman Joshi]] as Raju Rastogi in the movie ''3 Idiots'' and by [[Jiiva]] in ''Nanban''.
