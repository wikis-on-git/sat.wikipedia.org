He was a soldier in Indian military, Regiment 3 Jat and witnessed the 1962 Indo-China war, 1965 Indo-Pak war and 1971 Indo-Pak war. He always taught Manu and other kids the value of hard work and incessant practice. It was the result of hard work and practice that Manu rose to global horizon as a shooter. She initially practiced in a small shooting range in her school, Universal Public School Goria. But she was so much absorbed in this game that she enjoyed the game and practiced about ten hours daily, even on holidays. Her win inspired thousands of girls in her village.

In all the four Pistol & Rifle ISSF World Cups in 2018, she won the Gold medal in the 10m air pistol mixed event with Saurabh Chaudhry as her partner, making the pair a strong contendor for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
