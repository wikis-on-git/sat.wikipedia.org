== Career ==
=== 1980s–1990s ===
Tabu did a small appearance in the film ''Bazaar'' in 1980, and later in the film ''Hum Naujawan'' (1985) at the age of fourteen; she played [[Dev Anand]]'s daughter in the film. Her first role as an actress was in the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Coolie No. 1 (1991 film)|Coolie No.1]]'', co-starring with [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]]. In December 1987, Boney Kapoor launched two major films; ''[[Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1993 film)|Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja]]'' and ''[[Prem (film)|Prem]]''. In ''Prem'', Tabu was signed opposite Sanjay Kapoor. The film took eight years in making and it was the biggest flop in Boney Kapoor's production career. Tabu's career took off well after this film, in spite of the long delay.

Tabu's first release in Hindi as a leading lady was ''[[Pehla Pehla Pyar]]'', which went unnoticed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dhawan, M.L.|title=She wows with her acting prowess|date=15 April 2001|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010415/spectrum/main3.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=13 October 2007}}</ref> She came into prominence with her role in ''[[Vijaypath]]'', (1994) opposite [[Ajay Devgan]], for which she received the [[Filmfare Best Female Debut Award]]. This was followed by many films that did not do well at the box office. However, in this period she appeared in a successful movie [[Haqeeqat (1995 film)|Haqeeqat]](1995).

In 1996, Tabu had eight releases. Two films ''[[Saajan Chale Sasural]]'' and ''[[Jeet (1996 film)|Jeet]]'' went on to be hits; both were within the top five films of that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Box Office Results 1996|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/1996.htm|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=10 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070924121936/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/1996.htm |archivedate = 24 September 2007}}</ref> Her other significant film, ''[[Maachis]]'', was critically acclaimed. Her role as a Punjabi woman caught in the rise of Sikh insurgency was acclaimed; she went on to win her first [[National Film Award for Best Actress]] for her performance. The same year saw her major blockbuster films down south. She starred in the Telugu blockbuster ''[[Ninne Pelladata (1996 film)|Ninne Pelladata]]'', opposite Nagarjuna, a film which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu]]. The critically acclaimed Malayalam period epic film ''[[Kalapani (1996 film)|Kalapani]]'' directed by [[Priyadarshan]] with [[Mohanlal]] and [[Prabhu Ganesan]] in the lead roles, brought her laurels for her acting from all across South India. She also debuted in [[Kollywood]] through the highly successful Tamil film ''[[Kadhal Desam]]'', directed by [[Kathir]], with [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]] and [[Vineeth]].

Tabu's first release of 1997 was ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]''. The movie was about the real life events surrounding the [[Battle of Longewala]] during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. She played the role of [[Sunny Deol]]'s wife. Her role was small, but the film went on to be the biggest hit of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Box Office Results 1997|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/1997.htm|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=10 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070924122010/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/1997.htm |archivedate = 24 September 2007}}</ref> That year, she also starred in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Virasat (1997 film)|Virasat]]''.

In 2010, Tabu portrayed the lead role in the [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Toh Baat Pakki!]]'', which earned huge publicity as it marked Tabu's return to Bollywood after three years.

In this, she played the mother role to [[Shahid Kapoor]]'s character. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Tabu's performance as Ghazala Meer was critically acclaimed, with the New York Times saying that the film should have been titled Ghazala, rather than Haider.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/movies/haider-puts-an-indian-twist-on-hamlet.html|title='Haider' Puts an Indian Twist on 'Hamlet'|last=Saltz|first=Rachel|date=2 October 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=23 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Her next venture saw her teaming up with actor [[Ajay Devgan]] after a gap of 16 years.
