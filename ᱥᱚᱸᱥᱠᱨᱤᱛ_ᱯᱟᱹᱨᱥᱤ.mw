However, the details of this problem remain to be worked out, and in any case, it is unlikely that a complete letter-by-letter derivation will ever be possible; for Brahmi may have been more of an adaptation and remodeling, rather than a direct derivation, of the presumptive Semitic prototype, perhaps under the influence of a preexisting Indian tradition of phonetic analysis. However, the Semitic hypothesis 1s not so strong as to rule out the remote possibility that further discoveries could drastically change the picture. In particular, a relationship of some kind, probably partial or indirect, with the protohistoric Indus Valley script should not be considered entirely out of the question." {{harvnb|Salomon|1998|p=30}} }}<ref name="JainCardona2007-script1">{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Dhanesh |editor=George Cardona |editor2=Dhanesh Jain |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtCPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-79711-9|pages=47–66, 51|chapter=Sociolinguistics of the Indo-Aryan languages |quote=In the history of Indo-Aryan, writing was a later development and its adoption has been slow even in modern times. The first written word comes to us through Asokan inscriptions dating back to the third century BC. Originally, Brahmi was used to write Prakrit (MIA); for Sanskrit (OIA) it was used only four centuries later (Masica 1991: 135). The MIA traditions of Buddhist and Jain texts show greater regard for the written word than the OIA Brahminical tradition, though writing was available to Old Indo-Aryans.}}</ref><ref name="JainCardona2007-script2">{{cite book |last=Salomon |first=Richard |author-link=Richard G.

Thus scripts such as Gujarati, Bangla, and Oriya, as well as the major south Indian scripts, traditionally have been and often still are used in their proper territories for writing Sanskrit. Sanskrit, in other words, is not inherently linked to any particular script, although it does have a special historical connection with Nagari.}}</ref> ᱱᱮᱛᱟᱨ ᱫᱚ [[ᱫᱮᱵᱽᱱᱟᱜᱽᱨᱤ]] ᱵᱮᱵᱷᱟᱨᱚᱜ ᱠᱟᱱᱟ
