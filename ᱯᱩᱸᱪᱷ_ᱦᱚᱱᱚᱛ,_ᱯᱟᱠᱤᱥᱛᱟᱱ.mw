== History ==
{{Main articles|History of Poonch District}}
From the end of seventeenth century up to 1837 CE, Poonch was ruled by the Muslim [[Raja]]s of Loran in Tehsil [[Haveli District|Haveli]].  It then fell into the hands of Raja Faiztalab [[Sikh Empire|Punjab Government]].  Poonch was included in the transfer of the hilly country to [[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja Gulab Singh]]  of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] in 1848.  Before this transfer, Poonch was considered a district of [[Lahore]].  Maharaja Gulab Singh granted [[Chibhal|Chibal]], Poonch and other areas to Jawahar Singh and Moiti Singh. The Raja of Poonch had to present to the Maharaja one horse with gold trappings.  The Raja of Poonch was not to effect any administrative changes in the territory of Poonch without prior consultation with the Maharaja of [[Kashmir]].

After independence in 1947, there was a [[1947 Poonch rebellion|rebellion]] in the western part of the-then [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch District]]. The rebels led by Sardar [[Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (politician)|Muhammad Ibrahim Khan]], sought support from the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], which provided arms and then launched an [[Pakistani tribal invasion of Kashmir|invasion]] of its own, using [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Pashtun tribals]]. In response, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir joined India, and the conflict turned into an [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|Indo-Pakistani War]]. When a ceasefire was effected, the Poonch district was split across the two countries. The former capital city, [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]], came under the [[Poonch district, Jammu and Kashmir|Indian Poonch district]]. A new capital at [[Rawalakot]] was eventually established by Pakistan.

Of the four tehsils of the original Poonch district, viz., Bagh, Sudhnoti, Haveli, and Mendhar, the Pakistani [[Poonch Division]] included the first two and a portion of the third. All three tehsils were eventually made separate districts, and the new Poonch district was constituted in the centre of the Division by taking portions of the [[Bagh District|Bagh]] and [[Sudhnoti District|Sudhnoti]] tehsils.

==Administrative divisions==
The district is administratively subdivided into 4 [[tehsil]]s<ref>{{cite web |title=Tehsils of Poonch District on AJK map |url=https://www.ajk.gov.pk/ajkmap |website=ajk.gov.pk |publisher=AJK Official Portal |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>:
