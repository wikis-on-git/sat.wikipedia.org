==Separation of Poonch==

[[File:Pakistan - Azad Kashmir - Poonch (division).svg|thumb|Pakistan-administered portion of the [[Historical Poonch District|1947 Poonch district]], now called the [[Poonch Division]]]]

After independence in 1947, there was a [[1947 Poonch rebellion|rebellion]] in the western part of the-then [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch District]]. The rebels led by Sardar [[Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (politician)|Muhammad Ibrahim Khan]], sought support from the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], which provided arms and then launched an [[Pakistani tribal invasion of Kashmir|invasion]] of its own, using [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Pashtun tribals]]. In response, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir joined India, and the conflict turned into an [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|Indo-Pakistani War]]. When a ceasefire was effected, the Poonch district was split across the two countries. The former capital city, [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]], came under the [[Poonch district, Jammu and Kashmir|Indian Poonch district]]. A new capital at [[Rawalakot]] was eventually established by Pakistan.

Of the four tehsils of the original Poonch district, viz., Bagh, Sudhnoti, Haveli, and Mendhar, the Pakistani [[Poonch Division]] included the first two and a portion of the third. All three tehsils were eventually made separate districts, and the new Poonch district was constituted in the centre of the Division by taking portions of the [[Bagh District|Bagh]] and [[Sudhnoti District|Sudhnoti]] tehsils.

==Administrative divisions==
The district is administratively subdivided into 4 [[tehsil]]s<ref>{{cite web |title=Tehsils of Poonch District on AJK map |url=https://www.ajk.gov.pk/ajkmap |website=ajk.gov.pk |publisher=AJK Official Portal |accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>:
