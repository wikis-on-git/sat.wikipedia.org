'''Nandalal Bose''' (3 December 1882&nbsp;– 16 April 1966) was one of the pioneers of modern [[Indian art]] and a key figure of [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism|Contextual Modernism]].

A pupil of [[Abanindranath Tagore]], Bose was known for his "Indian style" of painting. He became the principal of [[Kala Bhavan]], [[Santiniketan]] in 1922. He was influenced by the [[Tagore family]] and the [[Ajanta Caves|murals of Ajanta]]; his classic works include paintings of scenes from Indian mythologies, women, and village life.

Today, many critics consider his paintings among India's most important modern paintings.<ref>{{cite news |title=San Diego museum showcases Nandalal Bose |url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2008/jun/25paint.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] News |date=25 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Art of Nandalal Bose' is first U.S. showcase for an Indian icon|author= Robert L.

Nandalal Bose was born on 3 December 1882 in a middle-class Bengali family of [[Kharagpur, Munger|Kharagpur]], in [[Munger district]] of [[Bihar]] state. His father, Purna Chandra Bose, was at that time working in the Darbhanga Estate.<ref name="RaoLitent2014">{{cite book|author1=C.H.Prahalada Rao|author2=Litent|title=Nandalal Bose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X47DAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP3|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Litent|pages=3–|id=GGKEY:D9L3P5T7YE4}}</ref> His mother Khetramoni Devi was a housewife with a skill in improvising toys and dolls for young Nandalal. From his early days Nandalal began taking an interest in modelling images and later, decorating Puja pandals.

In 1898, at the age of fifteen, Nandalal moved to Calcutta for his high school studies in the Central Collegiate School. After clearing his examinations in 1902, he continued his college studies at the same institution. In June 1903 he married Sudhiradevi, the daughter of a family friend. Nanadalal wanted to study art, but he was not given permission by his family. Unable to qualify for promotion in his classes, Nandalal moved to other colleges, joining the Presidency College in 1905 to study commerce. After repeated failures, he persuaded his family to let him study art at Calcutta's School of Art.<ref name="Kowshik1985">{{cite book|author=Dinkar k Kowshik|title=Nandalal Bose, the doyen of Indian art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNKfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 April 2012|year=1985|publisher=National Book Trust, India}}</ref>
