'''Nandalal Bose''' (3 December 1882&nbsp;– 16 April 1966) was one of the pioneers of modern [[Indian art]] and a key figure of [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism|Contextual Modernism]].

A pupil of [[Abanindranath Tagore]], Bose was known for his "Indian style" of painting. He became the principal of [[Kala Bhavan]], [[Santiniketan]] in 1922. He was influenced by the [[Tagore family]] and the [[Ajanta Caves|murals of Ajanta]]; his classic works include paintings of scenes from Indian mythologies, women, and village life.

Today, many critics consider his paintings among India's most important modern paintings.<ref>{{cite news |title=San Diego museum showcases Nandalal Bose |url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2008/jun/25paint.htm |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] News |date=25 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Art of Nandalal Bose' is first U.S. showcase for an Indian icon|author= Robert L.

Nandalal Bose was born on 3 December 1882 in a middle-class Bengali family of [[Kharagpur, Munger|Kharagpur]], in [[Munger district]] of [[Bihar]] state. His father, Purna Chandra Bose, was at that time working in the Darbhanga Estate.<ref name="RaoLitent2014">{{cite book|author1=C.H.Prahalada Rao|author2=Litent|title=Nandalal Bose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X47DAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP3|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Litent|pages=3–|id=GGKEY:D9L3P5T7YE4}}</ref> His mother Khetramoni Devi was a housewife with a skill in improvising toys and dolls for young Nandalal. From his early days Nandalal began taking an interest in modelling images and later, decorating Puja pandals.

In 1898, at the age of fifteen, Nandalal moved to Calcutta for his high school studies in the Central Collegiate School. After clearing his examinations in 1902, he continued his college studies at the same institution. In June 1903 he married Sudhiradevi, the daughter of a family friend. Nanadalal wanted to study art, but he was not given permission by his family. Unable to qualify for promotion in his classes, Nandalal moved to other colleges, joining the Presidency College in 1905 to study commerce. After repeated failures, he persuaded his family to let him study art at Calcutta's School of Art.<ref name="Kowshik1985">{{cite book|author=Dinkar k Kowshik|title=Nandalal Bose, the doyen of Indian art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNKfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 April 2012|year=1985|publisher=National Book Trust, India}}</ref>

As a young artist, Nandalal Bose was deeply influenced by the [[mural]]s of the [[Ajanta Caves]]. He had become part of an international circle of artists and writers seeking to revive classical Indian culture; a circle that already included [[Okakura Kakuzō]], [[William Rothenstein]], [[Yokoyama Taikan]], [[Christiana Herringham]], [[Laurence Binyon]], [[Abanindranath Tagore]], and the seminal London Modernist sculptors [[Eric Gill]] and [[Jacob Epstein]].<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modernism-modernity/summary/v018/18.1.arrowsmith.html Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, "The Transcultural Roots of Modernism: Imagist Poetry, Japanese Visual Culture, and the Western Museum System"], ''[[Modernism/modernity]]'' Volume 18, Number 1, January 2011, 27–42. {{ISSN|1071-6068}}.</ref><ref>[http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/cosmopolitanism-and-modernism Video of a Lecture mentioning Bose in the context of Indian influences n global modernism], ''[[London University School of Advanced Study]]'', March 2012.</ref>

To mark the 1930 occasion of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[History of the British salt tax in India#Mahatma Gandhi and the salt tax|arrest for protesting the British tax on salt]], Bose created a black on white linocut print of Gandhi walking with a staff. It became the iconic image for the non-violence movement.

His genius and original style were recognised by famous artists and art critics like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[O. C. Ganguli]]. These lovers of art felt that objective criticism was necessary for the development of painting and founded the Indian Society of Oriental Art.

He became principal of the Kala Bhavana (College of Arts) at Tagore's International University [[Santiniketan]] in 1922.

He was also famously asked by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to sketch the emblems for the Government of India's awards, including the [[Bharat Ratna]] and the [[Padma Shri]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nandalal Bose paintings on display in U.S.  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/03/15/stories/2008031556021400.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=15 March 2008 }}</ref> Along with his disciple [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha|Rammanohar]], Nandalal Bose took up the historic task of beautifying/decorating the original manuscript of the [[Constitution of India]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2672/ | title=The Constitution of India | accessdate=9 December 2010 | date=7 May 2009 | publisher=World Digital Library}}</ref>

He died on 16 April 1966 in Calcutta.

Today, the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in Delhi holds 7000 of his works in its collection, including a 1930 black and white [[linocut]] of the [[Dandi March]] depicting Mahatma Gandhi, and a set of seven posters he later made at the request of Mahatma Gandhi for the 1938 [[Haripura]] Session of the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bengal School of Art exhibition to open in US|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2008-06-24/news/28438579_1_art-exhibition-darielle-mason-bengal-school |publisher=[[The Economic Times]] |date=24 June 2008 }}</ref>
