The '''Bengal Presidency''', officially the '''Presidency of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]]''' and later '''Bengal Province''', was a subdivision of the [[British India|British Empire in India]]. At the height of its territorial jurisdiction, it covered large parts of what is now [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Bengal proper covered the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]] (present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the [[West Bengal|Indian state of West Bengal]]). [[Calcutta]], the city which grew around Fort William, was the capital of the Bengal Presidency. For many years, the [[Governor of Bengal]] was concurrently the [[Viceroy of India]] and Calcutta was the de facto [[capital of India]] until the early 20th-century.

The Bengal Presidency emerged from trading posts established in [[Mughal Bengal]] during the reign of Emperor Jahangir in 1612. The Honourable East India Company (HEIC), a British monopoly with a Royal Charter, competed with other European companies to gain influence in Bengal. After the decisive overthrow of the Nawab of Bengal in 1757 and the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the HEIC expanded its control over much of the Indian subcontinent. This marked the beginning of [[Company rule in India]], when the HEIC emerged as the most powerful military force in the subcontinent. The British Parliament gradually withdrew the monopoly of the HEIC. By the 1850s, the HEIC struggled with finances.<ref name="autogenerated1">William Dalrymple (10 September 2019). The Anarchy: The Relentless Rise of the East India Company. Bloomsbury Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4088-6440-1}}.</ref> After the [[Indian Mutiny]] of 1857, the British government assumed direct administration of India. The Bengal Presidency was re-organized. In the early 20th-century, Bengal emerged as a hotbed of the [[Indian independence movement]], as well as the epicenter of the [[Bengali Renaissance]].

Bengal was the economic, cultural and educational hub of the [[British Raj]]. During the period of [[proto-industrialization]], Bengal significantly contributed directly to the [[Industrial revolution]] in Britain, although it was soon overtaken by the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] ruled by [[Tipu Sultan]] as [[South Asia]]'s dominant economic power.<ref name="Parthasarathi">{{Citation |title=Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600–1850 |given=Prasannan |surname=Parthasarathi |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-139-49889-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_YEcvo-jqcC}}</ref> When Bengal was reorganized, [[Penang]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]] were separated into the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1867.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/bd541c73-58ef-4bb1-9de7-173f00913286 |title=The Straits Settlements becomes a residency - Singapore History |publisher=Eresources.nlb.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> [[British Burma]] became a province of India and a later a [[Crown Colony]] in itself. Western areas, including the [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] and [[Punjab Province (British India)|The Punjab]], were further reorganized. Northeastern areas became [[Colonial Assam]]. The [[Partition of British India]] in 1947 resulted in [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Bengal's division]] on religious grounds.
