'''Achyutananda Das '''([[Odia]]:-''ଅଚ୍ୟୁତାନନ୍ଦ ଦାସ'' ) or '''Mahapurusha Achyutananda''' was a 16th-century poet seer and [[Vaishnava]] saint from [[Odisha]], India. He was considered to have the power to see the past, present and future. He was a prolific author, and one of the group of five, that led a revolution in spirituality in Odisha by translating [[Sanskrit]] texts into the Odia language for common people.

He was one of the famous five friends of spirituality and literature [[Odia literature|Panchasakhā]], who transcribed ancient [[Hindu]] Sanskrit texts into Odia, for the people of Udra Desha ([[Odisha]]). Shri Achyutananda Das was the most prolific writer of the Panchasakhas<ref>Chaini, p.7</ref> and wrote numerous books, many of which could be loosely translated as the Book of Prophecies. He is known as the Mahapurusha (a Great Person) for his vast knowledge on many subjects such as spirituality, Yoga, rituals, Buddhist Tantra, [[Ayurveda]] (science of life, longevity and medicine), and other various science and social regulations.

As Achyutananda became a popular figure, much of his life began to become legend. He is famous for being one of the few who wrote about the social situation of his time<ref>Chaini, p. 14</ref> and this is a scholarly reason many study his writings. His poetry was often cryptic about himself, and written in code or analogies. Mahapurusha Achyutananda belonged to Gopala([[Yadava]]) caste by birth.<ref>Das, p.iii of preface</ref> His surname Das means servant of God.

=== ᱡᱟᱱᱟᱢ ===
Achyutananda was born in a village by the name "tilakana"
',<ref>Due to lPANDIT LATE KURAMANI PATHI SAHRAMA THE EXACT LOCATION OF BIRTH PLACE OF SRI ACHYUTANDA HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.</ref> where two distributaries of the Mahanadi, Luna(Labana Dhara) and Chitrotpala bifurcated, of Cuttack district of Odisha, during the twenty first anka (year of region) of the Gajapati (king) Purushottam Deva. This is thought to be somewhere between 1480 and 1505 by different scholars.<br />

His mother was Padmavati, and his father was Dinabandhu Khuntia, and his grandfather was Gopinath Mohanty, a scribe in the [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Jagannath Temple]], Puri. He was born after his mother prayed at the pillar in front of the Jagannath Temple, and his father had a dream that the divine bird [[Garuda]] brought him a child. In legend he is believed to be an incarnation of Garuda.

Achyutananda had a formal education in Puri. It is agreed by most texts that, like many contemporaries, he met Shri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] in his youth, but did not become a follower of Chaitanya Mahapabhu's [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]]. He became the youngest of the Panchasakhā.<ref>Sri Sri Mahapurusa Siddha Ashram, p.5</ref>
