Born in [[Dawoodi Bohra|Bohri Muslim]] family, her father, Tanvir, is a businessman and her mother, Tasneem, is a housewife.

Bharucha began her film career in 2006 with 'Jai Santoshi Maa' and then the 2009 film ''[[Kal Kissne Dekha]]''. Her next release was [[Dibakar Banerjee]]'s suspense film ''[[Love Sex Aur Dhokha]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=102|title=Love Sex Aur Dhokha|website=Box Office India}}</ref> In 2011, she appeared in [[Luv Ranjan]]'s buddy drama ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama]]'', featuring an ensemble cast in which she was cast opposite [[Kartik Aaryan]].

Bharucha then starred in Ranjan's 2013 unsuccessful romantic drama ''[[Akaash Vani]]'' as the titular female lead opposite Aaryan and [[Sunny Nijar]]. Her first film of 2015, ''[[Darr @ The Mall]]'' opposite [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], was a major box-office disaster. Later that year, she appeared in a sequel to ''Pyaar Ka Punchnama'' entitled ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2]]'', which paired her opposite Aaryan again, alongside debutante [[Sunny Singh (actor)|Sunny Singh Nijjar]]. It became her first major commercial success, and her second success, earning over {{INRConvert|880|m}} worldwide.

In 2018, Bharucha reunited with Aaryan and Nijjar in Ranjan's ''[[Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety]]'', a romantic comedy about a man who tries to separate his friend from his fiancée as he thinks her to be a gold digger. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, ''Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety'' proved to be a blockbuster with domestic earnings of over {{INRConvert|1.07|b}}, and became Bharucha's first release to enter the [[100 Crore Club]]. It emerged as one of her most successful as well.

In the next year, Bharucha played [[Ayushmann Khurrana]]'s romantic interest in [[Raaj Shaandilyaa]]'s comedy film ''[[Dream Girl (2019 film)|Dream Girl]]''. It received generally positive reviews from critics. ''Dream Girl'' grossed {{INRConvert|1|b}} at the domestic box office within 10 days of its release becoming Bharucha's second consecutive film to cross the mark of 100 Crore Club;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hindustantimes.com/bollywood/dream-girl-box-office-collection-day-4-ayushmann-khurrana-starrer-declared-a-hit-his-fastest-film-to-cross-rs-50-crore/story-Ur4gYV5Tyeea5PfyNhfP1K_amp.html|title=Dream Girl box office collection day 4: Ayushmann Khurrana starrer declared a hit, his fastest film to cross Rs 50 crore|publisher=The Hindustan Times|accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref> with a worldwide gross of over {{INRConvert|1.9|b}}, it also emerged as her highest-grossing release. Also that year, she performed an item number "Peeyo Datt Ke" in the [[Milap Zaveri]]-directed 
thriller ''[[Marjaavaan]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/marjaavaan-nushrat-bharucha-and-sidharth-malhotra-shoot-for-a-yo-yo-honey-singh-song-titled-peeyu-datke/amp_articleshow/69984685.cms|title='Marjaavaan': Nushrat Bharucha and Sidharth Malhotra Shoot for a Yo Yo Honey Singh song titled 'Peeyu Datke'|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> sung by [[Yo Yo Honey Singh]].

As of July 2019, Bharucha has finished work on [[Hansal Mehta]]'s social film ''[[Chhalaang]]'', in which she is paired opposite [[Rajkummar Rao]] for the second time, and has been filming Nikhil Nagesh Tiwari's romantic thriller ''[[Hurdang]]'' opposite [[Sunny Kaushal]] and [[Vijay Varma]].
