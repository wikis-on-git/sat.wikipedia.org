== Foundation of Bidanasi Katak or Cuttack City ==

Ananga Bhima Deva III became the ruler of the ancient land of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] in the year 1211 A.D. At the time of his coronation, his kingdom faced repeated attacks from the Muslim forces of [[Ghiyasuddin Iwaj Shah]], the ruler of [[Bengal]]. The [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] kings had been struggling to take over the territory of Odisha from the times of the [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavanshi]] rulers and the western frontier of Anangabhima's kingdom was repeatedly violated by them. Anangabhima chose the strategic location on the bifurcation of rivers [[Mahanadi]] and Katthajodi for the site of his new capital and moved his capital to Baranasi Katak.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=11 August 2017|title=HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE OF CUTTACK TOWN|url=http://magazines.odisha.gov.in/Journal/Journal2/pdf/ohrj-018.pdf|journal=Magazines Odisha Gov|volume=|pages=132|via=}}</ref> In 1230 A.D he moved his headquarters to the new capital. Katak literally means a fortification. The city was named as Bidanasi Katak (new Varanasi fort)  and a new fort complex called [[Barabati fort|Barabati]] was constructed to build up his military force under the guidance of his able Brahman minister and military adviser named as Vishnu.
