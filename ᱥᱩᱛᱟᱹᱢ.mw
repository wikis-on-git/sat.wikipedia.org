|Fusible
|Fuses sewn fabrics together when ironed
|binding and appliqué
|-
|Linen
|A spun thread, typically in a thicker gauge than that used for fabric garments. It may be waxed for durability and resistance to mildew.
|Traditional leather saddlery; leather luggage, handbags, and accessories; and beadwork.

|Nylon
|A transparent monofillament which can be melted by an iron. Nylon is usually stronger than polyester.

|Polyester
|A synthetic blend which is stronger and stretchier than cotton with little or no lint (may be texturized)
|strength
|-
|Rayon
|Made from cellulose, but not considered to be a natural fibre because it is highly processed. Useful for obtaining bright colors, though not always color-fast.
|high sheen, soft texture

|Silk
|A very fine, strong and hard-to-see thread; tends to degrade over time, however.
|high strength and often high sheen, used for attaching beads

Polyester/polyester core spun thread is made by wrapping staple polyester around a continuous polyester filament during spinning and plying these yarns into a sewing thread. [http://www.amefird.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Why-use-Core-versus-Spun-Poly-2-8-10.pdf Core Spun Thread]

== Different weights ==

=== ᱥᱩᱛᱟᱹᱢ gauges ===
Yarns are measured by the density of the yarn, which is described by various units of textile measurement relating to a standardized length per weight. These units do not directly correspond to thread diameter.

==== Wt and Gunze count ====
The most common weight system specifies the length of the thread in kilometres required to weigh 1 kilogram. Therefore, a greater weight ''number'' (indicated in the American standard by the abbreviation ''wt'') indicates a thinner, finer thread. The American standard of thread weight was adopted from the Gunze Count standard of Japan which uses two numbers separated by a forward slash. The first number corresponds to the ''wt'' number of the thread and the second number indicates how many strands of fiber were used to compose the finished thread. It is common to wrap three strands of the same weight to make one thread, though this is not a formal requirement in the US standard (which is therefore less informative).
