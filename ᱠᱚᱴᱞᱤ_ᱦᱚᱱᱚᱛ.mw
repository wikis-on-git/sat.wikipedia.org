According to the same report, district Kotli is ranked at 119 nationally with a readiness score of  35.47 and retention score of 35.36.<ref name="report" /> The learning score is low because of lack of quality teachers and no proper formal teacher training. The retention score is low because of low number of beyond primary schools.

When it comes to infrastructure, Kotli ranks at 154 which is the second lowest with a score of 14.14.<ref name="report" /> This shows there is a serious problem and lack of provision of basic facilities like electricity, functional toilets, furniture and lack of boundary walls.
