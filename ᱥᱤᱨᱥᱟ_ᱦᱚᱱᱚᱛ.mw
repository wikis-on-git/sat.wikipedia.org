==Origin of name==
The district is named after its headquarters, Sirsa. The name, Sirsa is derived from its ancient [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] name ''Sairishaka'', which is mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Ashtadhyayi]] and the [[Divyavadana]]. In ''Mahabharata'', Sairishaka is described as being taken by [[Nakula]] in his conquest of the western quarter. It must have been a flourishing city in the 5th century B.C. as it has been mentioned by [[Pāṇini|Panini]].
