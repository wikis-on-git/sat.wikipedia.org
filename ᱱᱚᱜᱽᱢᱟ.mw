Inspired by her entrepreneurial background, Nagma forayed into the clothing business by opening a boutique in Mumbai in Bandra West on Hill Road called Nagma's, which was inaugurated in September 2000 by [[Akshay Kumar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/tamil/features/nagma.html|title=Akshay inaugurates Nagma's boutique|publisher=|access-date=31 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224212411/http://movies.indiainfo.com/tamil/features/nagma.html|archive-date=24 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although the boutique was highly successful and an instant hit, she had to shut it down in 2003 as she had to be by the side of her ailing father while simultaneously honouring her Bhojpuri and other language film commitments apart from her spiritual quest, then teaching [[Art of Living Foundation|Art of Living]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/wc2003/2003/mar/06news.htm|title=Ganguly?s career was at stake, so we parted: Nagma|publisher=Rediff.com|access-date=20 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112053505/http://www.rediff.com/wc2003/2003/mar/06news.htm|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nagma's debut film ''[[Baaghi: A Rebel for Love|Baghi: A Rebel for Love]]'', opposite [[Salman Khan]] was Hindi cinema's seventh highest-grossing film in 1990.<ref>[http://www.boxofficeindia.com/1990.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407110220/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/1990.htm|date=7 April 2007}}</ref> With [[Karisma Kapoor]], she was also one of the female leads in 1994's ''[[Suhaag (1994 film)|Suhaag]]'' with [[Ajay Devgan]] and [[Akshay Kumar]]. Following these films, she moved south to star in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] movies at the behest of her friend [[Divya Bharti]]. Explaining her shift, she cited what she was more conscious of the quality of work, in terms of meaty roles and her flair to travel throughout India understanding different cultures and her drive and passion to get acclamation from all over India. She stated "Language was never a barrier. I love adventure, culture and have great respect for the Indian tradition".

Her Telugu films include 1992's ''Gharana Mogudu'' with [[Chiranjeevi]], ''Allari Alludu'' with [[Nagarjuna Akkineni]] and ''Major Chandrakanth'' with [[N. T. Rama Rao]] and [[Mohan Babu]]. Her Tamil films include ''Baasha'' with [[Rajnikanth]] , 1994's ''Kadhalan'' with [[Prabhu Deva]]and ''Villadhi villain'' with [[Sathyaraj]] where she portrayed very glamourous

After moving back to Mumbai, she told an interviewer in 2001, "The pressure of being the number one actress in Tamil cinema was getting to me. I was unhappy with the kind of films I was doing. I couldn't do the kind of work I wanted to because I had to go by the dictates of what the audience expected of a much-in-demand actress. I was stagnating so I decided to take a break."<ref>Filmfare interview, May 2001 "Clean Bowled&nbsp;– Match-fixing... and much more with Nagma" at [http://downloads.movies.indiatimes.com/site/may2001/ivw10.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013153300/http://downloads.movies.indiatimes.com/site/may2001/ivw10.html |date=13 October 2007 }}</ref> Again based in Hindi cinema, she focused on supporting roles in films like 2000's ''Chal Mere Bhai'', which reunited her with former co-stars [[Karisma Kapoor]], [[Salman Khan]] and [[Sanjay Dutt]]. Within a year, Nagma enrolled in the spiritually oriented [[Art of Living Foundation|Art of Living]] course, eventually teaching it herself in Mumbai and elsewhere.<ref>"Nagma practices the art of living!"

When asked why she shifted to Bhojpuri films, she said "I wanted to do films in different languages. I have already done movies in 10 languages. My first Bhojpuri film ''Panditji Bataayina Biyaah Kab Hoii'' was a huge hit.

She contested 2014 Lok Sabha elections from [[Meerut (Lok Sabha constituency) | Meerut]] as Congress candidate, but came a distant fourth with less than 5% votes and lost her deposit.  

In a 2006 interview, she made a direct link between her family history and her political activism: "My mom is Muslim and my dad is Hindu. We were brought up to respect all religions. Communal riots pained me. I wanted to do something. So I joined politics.". She had to turn down an offer to run for India's [[Lok Sabha]] in 2003 due to her many film commitments.
