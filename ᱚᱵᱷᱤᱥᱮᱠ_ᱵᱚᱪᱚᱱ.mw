== Career ==
Abhishek Bachchan has starred in over 50 films in both lead and supporting roles.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

=== 2000–2003 ===
In 2000, Bachchan made his film debut playing the male lead in [[J. P. Dutta]]'s war drama ''[[Refugee (2000 film)|Refugee]]'' opposite [[Kareena Kapoor]], who was also making her debut in the film. Although the film only performed moderately well at the box office, both Bachchan and Kapoor received positive reviews for their performances. Film critic Taran Adarsh wrote that he "has all it takes to emerge a competent actor in years to come. Even in his debut-making film, Abhishek comes across as a fine actor and lives up to his family name."<ref>{{cite web|last=Adarsh|first=Taran|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/eemicro/criticreview/id/540318|website=Bollywood Hungama|title=Refugee|date=15 December 2000|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>

Bachchan also shot for a cameo in the 2001 film ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'', a scene which was later edited out of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/abhishek-bachchan-kareena-kapoor-k3g-deleted-scene-1040527-2017-09-08|title=Flashback Friday: Did you know Abhishek Bachchan was in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham?|date=8 September 2017 |website=India Today|language=en|access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref>

After ''Refugee'', Bachchan starred in a series of poorly received films that failed to make a mark at the box office. However, his performance in [[Sooraj R. Barjatya]]'s romantic dramedy ''[[Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon]]'' (2003) earned him his first nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and he went on to win the award the following year for his performance in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s political drama ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004).

=== 2004–2009 ===
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2019}}
Bachchan better established himself in [[Hindi cinema]] playing a no-nonsense [[Mumbai Police|Mumbai police officer]] in the blockbuster [[action film|action]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Dhoom]]'' (2004), which also starred [[Uday Chopra]], [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]], [[Esha Deol]], and [[Rimi Sen]] in pivotal roles. His next two films were ''[[Phir Milenge (2004 film)|Phir Milenge]]'' (2004) and ''[[Naach (2004 film)|Naach]]'' (2004).

Bachchan's first release of 2005 was the crime comedy ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'', which featured him and [[Rani Mukerji]] as the titular con artist duo who perform several successful heists and fall in love along the way. The film emerged as the second highest-grossing [[Bollywood films of 2005|Bollywood film of 2005]], and earned him a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]]. This film also marked his first professional collaboration with his father [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who played a police officer closely following the lead pair.

Bachchan was next seen in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s political drama ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'', which was a moderate success at the box office. His performance as the morally upright son of a troubled politician (played by his father [[Amitabh Bachchan]]) earned him rave reviews from critics as well as his second consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. His next two releases ''[[Dus]]'' (2005) and ''[[Bluffmaster!]]'' (2005) were both moderately successful, but did not earn much critical appreciation.

Bachchan won his third consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in [[Karan Johar]]'s critically acclaimed romantic drama ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), which emerged as a moderate commercial success despite the fact that it dealt with the controversial subject of marital infidelity. Bachchan played the role of a man whose wife ([[Rani Mukerji]]) is unhappy with their marriage, and so begins an affair with a friend ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) who is also unhappy with his marriage to his wife ([[Preity Zinta]]).

Bachchan then starred opposite [[Aishwarya Rai]] in the period romance ''[[Umrao Jaan (2006 film)|Umrao Jaan]]'', a remake of the [[Umrao Jaan (1981 film)|1981 film of the same name]] starring [[Rekha]] and [[Farooq Sheikh]] in the lead roles. The film failed to earn the same level of appreciation as the original, and was also a commercial failure. He was next seen in ''[[Dhoom 2]]'' (2006), which featured him and Uday Chopra reprising their roles from the original ''[[Dhoom]]'' (2004) joined by new cast members [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Aishwarya Rai]], and [[Bipasha Basu]]. The film emerged as the highest-grossing [[Bollywood films of 2006|Bollywood film of 2006]], but some critics commented that Bachchan was "reduced to a mere supporting player"<ref>{{cite web|last=Masand |first=Rajeev |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-verdict-go-dhoom-2/26974-8-1.html |website=IBN Live |title=Masand's Verdict: Go ''Dhoom 2'' |date=26 November 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115503/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/masands-verdict-go-dhoom-2/26974-8-1.html |archivedate=27 November 2012  }}</ref> to his co-star Roshan.

Bachchan earned much critical acclaim for his performance in Mani Ratnam's ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]'' (2007), loosely based on the life of business magnate [[Dhirubhai Ambani]]."<ref name="rediff2007">{{cite web|last=Sen|first=Raja|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/12guru.htm|website=Rediff India Abroad|title=Watch ''Guru'' for the actors|date=12 January 2007}}</ref> The film starred him alongside [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] (their first professional collaboration after marriage), [[R. Madhavan]], [[Mithun Chakraborty]], [[Vidya Balan]], and [[Arya Babbar]]. The film was a commercial success at the box office.

His next release was the dance comedy ''[[Jhoom Barabar Jhoom]]'' (2007) alongside [[Preity Zinta]], [[Bobby Deol]], and [[Lara Dutta]]. The film was declared average by Box Office India and was a moderate success overseas. He was then seen playing a minor role in the female-centric drama ''[[Laaga Chunari Mein Daag]]'' (2007) as the love interest of the film's lead actress [[Rani Mukerji]].

Bachchan's first release of 2008 was [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s ''[[Sarkar Raj]]'', which featured him and his father [[Amitabh Bachchan]] reprising their roles from ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005) while his wife [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] entered the cast as a new addition. This film proved to be successful at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. His next release was the [[fantasy]] [[adventure film]] ''[[Drona (2008 film)|Drona]]'' (2008), which was a major failure both critically and commercially.

Bachchan was next seen in ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]'' (2008), a romantic comedy about two men (Bachchan and [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) who pretend to be gay in order to be allowed to live with a girl ([[Priyanka Chopra]]), but then find that they have both fallen in love with her. The film was a major success at the box office, and earned him a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]].

Bachchan's first release of 2009 was ''[[Delhi-6]]'', which received a lukewarm response from critics. Later that year he was seen in the family dramedy ''[[Paa (film)|Paa]]'', which he also produced. The film's plot centered on a boy ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) who suffers from [[progeria]] whose parents were played by Abhishek Bachchan and [[Vidya Balan]]. For his work as a producer on the film, Bachchan earned the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi]].

Only [[Dum Maaro Dum (film)|Dum Maaro Dum]] did well that year and was declared above average at the box office.

Bachchan then played the lead role in [[Rohit Shetty]]'s comedy ''[[Bol Bachchan]]'' (2012), which was a major blockbuster at the box office despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. Film critic Anupama Chopra called Bachchan a "good part of the film" and also commented that he "manages to sparkle even in a script that is lazy and determinedly lowbrow".<ref>{{cite web|last=Chopra |first=Anupama |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/reviews/anupama-chopra-s-review-bol-bachchan/article1-884509.aspx |website=Hindustan Times |title=Anupama Chopra's review: Bol Bachchan |date=7 July 2012 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107042529/http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/reviews/anupama-chopra-s-review-bol-bachchan/article1-884509.aspx |archivedate=7 November 2014 }}</ref> Bachchan received several awards for his role (Including [[Screen Awards|Screen]] & [[IIFA Awards|IIFA]]).

In this instalment of the series, they were joined by [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Katrina Kaif]]. While the film became a major blockbuster, most critics commented that Bachchan's performance was overshadowed by Khan's.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chute|first=David|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-dhoom-3-1200983530/|website=Variety|title=Film Review: 'Dhoom: 3'|date=21 December 2013|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' currently ranks among the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films#Highest-grossing Hindi films|highest-grossing Hindi films]] of all time.
