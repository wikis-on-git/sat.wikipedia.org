'''Abhishek Bachchan''' (born 5 February 1976) is an Indian film actor and film producer known for his work in [[Bollywood]]. Part of the [[Bachchan family]], he is the son of actors [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Jaya Bachchan]].

His first commercial successes came with the 2004 action films ''[[Dhoom]]'' and ''[[Run (2004 film)|Run]]'', which changed his career prospects. Bachchan went on to earn critical appreciation for his performances in the dramas ''[[Yuva]]'' (2004), ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), which won him three consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In 2007, he portrayed a character loosely based on [[Dhirubhai Ambani]] in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s drama film ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]'', which earned him critical acclaim and a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]].

Bachchan has also played leading and supporting roles in commercially successful comedies and dramas, including ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005), ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005),   ''[[Bluffmaster!]]'' (2005), ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]'' (2007),  ''[[Jhoom Barabar Jhoom]]'' (2007), ''[[Dostana (2008 film)|Dostana]]'' (2008), ''[[Dum Maaro Dum (film)|Dum Maro Dum]]'' (2011), ''[[Bol Bachchan]]'' (2012), ''[[Happy New Year (2014 film)|Happy New Year]]'' (2014), and ''[[Housefull 3]]'' (2016). His highest-grossing releases include the action sequels ''[[Dhoom]]'' (2004), ''[[Dhoom 2]]'' (2006), and ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficeindia.com/actor.php?actorid=48 |title=Abhishek Bachchan |website=Box Office India |access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref>
