Being one of the seven siblings of a poor family, he had to do odd jobs to make ends meet and suffers from [[acromegaly]], which among other effects causes [[gigantism]] and chin protrusion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/star-wrestler-great-khali-tumor-removed-caused-size/story?id=16874060|title=WWE Star Great Khali's Growth-Inducing Tumor Removed|date=29 July 2012|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> When Rana was serving as a security guard in [[Shimla]], he caught the eye of a police officer from the neighbouring State of Punjab that''—''having previously helped several employees of Punjab Police to become international sportspersons''—''got him inducted into the Punjab Police in 1993,<ref name="indiatimes">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2910680.cms|title=Khali still on Punjab police pay rolls|accessdate=15 June 2008|date=30 March 2008|publisher=The Times of India|first1=Rohit|last1=Mullick}}</ref> and (though Rana was reluctant to leave [[Himachal Pradesh]], his brother was also offered a job in the Punjab Police) once he landed in Punjab's [[Jalandhar]], Rana trained in the local gyms to become a wrestler and soon he got selected for specialised wrestling training in the United States.<ref name="Daily News and Analysis">{{cite news|title=8-FT-HIGH DOORS AWAIT 'THE GREAT KHALI' IN NATIVE VILLAGE|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-8-ft-high-doors-await-the-great-khali-in-native-village-1162883|accessdate=14 March 2016|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=5 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314131848/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-8-ft-high-doors-await-the-great-khali-in-native-village-1162883|archivedate=14 March 2016}}</ref>

Rana suggested the ring name The Great Khali after the Hindu [[goddess]] [[Kali]], who is associated with eternal energy.<ref name="bbc"/>

Rana's training schedule consists of two hours of [[weight training]], morning and evening, every day, but his diet is unclear, as in some interviews it was claimed he maintains his size on a vegetarian diet<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7384920.stm|title=BBC NEWS – South Asia – Giant wrestler finds fame in India|work=bbc.co.uk|date=6 May 2008}}</ref> and in other interviews it was claimed he consumes vast quantities of chicken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100525/jsp/entertainment/story_12482840.jsp|title=Gentle Giant|last=t2|date=25 May 2010|publisher=The Telegraph, Calcutta, India|page=1|accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> He has since clarified that he loves vegetarian food, but also consumes meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingtruth.com/news/great-khali-debeats-with-indian-media-about-how-fake-wrestling-is/|title=Great Khali Debeats With Indian Media About How Fake Wrestling Is|last=Balderson|first=Keelan|author2=Rajat Sharma|date=22 February 2010|publisher=www.wrestlingtruth.com|page=1|accessdate=8 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224054111/http://wrestlingtruth.com/news/great-khali-debeats-with-indian-media-about-how-fake-wrestling-is/|archivedate=24 February 2010}}</ref>

On 26 July 2012 it was reported that Rana underwent a brain surgery due to a tumor on his [[pituitary gland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/home/2280702-74/singh-tumor-maroon-wrestling-upmc-team-according-condition-khali-led|title=Wrestling star Great Khali has tumor removed at UPMC|publisher=TribLIVE|date=26 July 2012|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>
