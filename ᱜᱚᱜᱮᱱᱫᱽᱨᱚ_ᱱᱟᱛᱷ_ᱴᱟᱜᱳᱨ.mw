Gaganendranath Tagore was born at [[Jorasanko]] into a family whose creativity defined Bengal's cultural life. Gaganendranath was the eldest son of Gunendranath Tagore, grandson of Girindranath Tagore and a great-grandson of Prince [[Dwarkanath Tagore]]. His brother Abanindranath was a pioneer and leading exponent of the Bengal School of Art. He was a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and the paternal great-grandfather of actress [[Sharmila Tagore]].

Gaganendranath received no formal education but trained under the watercolourist Harinarayan Bandopadhyay. In 1907, along with his brother Abanindranath, he founded the Indian Society of Oriental Art which later published the influential journal ''Rupam''. Between 1906 and 1910, the artist studied and assimilated Japanese brush techniques and the influence of Far Eastern art into his own work, as demonstrated by his illustrations for Rabindranath Tagore's autobiography ''Jeevansmriti'' (1912). He went on to develop his own approach in his ''Chaitanya'' and ''Pilgrim'' series. Gaganendranath eventually abandoned the revivalism of the Bengal School and took up caricature. The ''Modern Review'' published many of his cartoons in 1917. From 1917 onwards, his satirical lithographs appeared in a series of books, including ''Play of Opposites'', ''Realm of the Absurd'' and ''Reform Screams''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terracciano|first=Emilia|title=Bengal School Painting from the Collection of L.T.P Manjusri (1902-82)|publisher=Oliver Forge Brendan Lynch|chapter-url=http://www.pagegangster.com/p/XxATR/42/|chapter=Biographical Notes}}</ref>

Between 1920 and 1925, Gaganendranath pioneered experiments in modernist painting.<ref>Kasturbhai Lalbhai Museum, [[Ahmenabad]]</ref> Partha Mitter describes him as "the only Indian painter before the 1940s who made use of the language and syntax of Cubism in his painting".<ref name="Mitter2007">{{cite book|author=Partha Mitter|title=The Triumph of Modernism: India's Artists and the Avant-Garde, 1922-1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krdWkzVLSbkC&pg=PA18|year=2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-318-5|page=18}}</ref> From 1925 onwards, the artist developed a complex post-cubist style.

Gaganendranath also took a keen interest in theatre, and wrote a children's book in the manner of Lewis Carroll, ''Bhodor Bahadur'' ('Otter the Great').<ref>{{cite web|title=Gaganendranath Tagore|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/gaganendranath-tagore|publisher=Grove Art Encyclopaedia, Oxford University Press}}</ref>
