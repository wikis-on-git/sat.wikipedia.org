== Location ==
The [[Neelum River]] was known before [[Partition of India|Partition]] as ''Kishan Ganga'' and was subsequently renamed after the village of [[Neelam (village)|Neelam]].<ref>{{harvnb|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|p=65}}. The village is {{convert|12|km}} upstream from Athmuqam. An alternative etymology links the name to the colour of the river: "sapphire". {{harv|Faruqi|2016}}</ref> It flows down from the [[Gurez Valley]] in Indian [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and roughly follows first a western and then a south-western course until it joins the [[Jhelum River]] at [[Muzaffarabad]]. The valley is a thickly wooded{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} region with an elevation ranging between {{convert|4000|ft}} and {{convert|7500|ft}}, the mountain peaks on either side reaching {{convert|17000|ft}}.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|p=65}}<!--source only for elevation--> Neelum Valley is {{Convert|144|km}} long.<ref>{{cite web |title=Length of Neelum Valley |url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/opinion/blog/navigating-the-neelum-valley-what-to-remember/ |website=en.dailypakistan.com.pk |accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>

Most of the valley is taken up by the Neelum District({{lang-ur|{{nq|ضلع نیلم}}}}). The district is bordered on the south-west by [[Muzaffarabad District]], which also encompasses the lower reaches of the valley; to the north-west beyond the mountains lies the [[Kaghan Valley]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]'s [[Mansehra District]]; to the north and north-east are the [[Diamer District|Diamer]], [[Astore District|Astore]] and [[Skardu District|Skardu]] districts of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]. To the south and east are the [[Kupwara district|Kupwara]] and [[Bandipora district|Bandipora]] districts of Indian Kashmir. The [[Line of Control]] runs through the valley – either across the mountains to the south-east, or in places right along the river, with several villages on the left bank falling on the Indian side of the border.<ref>{{harvnb|Baart|Rehman|2005|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|pp=65–66}}.</ref>
