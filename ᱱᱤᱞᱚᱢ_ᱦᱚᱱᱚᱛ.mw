Most of the valley is taken up by the Neelum District({{lang-ur|{{nq|ضلع نیلم}}}}). The district is bordered on the south-west by [[Muzaffarabad District]], which also encompasses the lower reaches of the valley; to the north-west beyond the mountains lies the [[Kaghan Valley]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]'s [[Mansehra District]]; to the north and north-east are the [[Diamer District|Diamer]], [[Astore District|Astore]] and [[Skardu District|Skardu]] districts of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]]. To the south and east are the [[Kupwara district|Kupwara]] and [[Bandipora district|Bandipora]] districts of Indian Kashmir. The [[Line of Control]] runs through the valley – either across the mountains to the south-east, or in places right along the river, with several villages on the left bank falling on the Indian side of the border.<ref>{{harvnb|Baart|Rehman|2005|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|pp=65–66}}.</ref>

Like the rest of Kashmir, beyond primary education is a problem for the students as the number of schools catering for beyond primary education are less.

When it comes to infrastructure, Neelum district ranks at 144 nationally, with school infrastructure score of 21.04 which is low and shows how poor the buildings and furniture are. Issues reported in [https://elections.alifailaan.pk/taleemdo-app/ TaleemDo!] App  by students of Neelum mainly focus on no proper furniture and building walls in schools, as reflected in the poor infrastructure score. Another issue reported was that there is a place in Neelum which still doesn't have a school building. Students have to receive education in miserable conditions.
