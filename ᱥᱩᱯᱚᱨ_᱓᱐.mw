In 2002, Abhayanand and Anand Kumar started Super 30 with the plan to select 30 talented students from economically impoverished sections who could not afford IIT coaching. These 30 students were then prepared to pass [[Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced|IIT-JEE]] examinations. Anand Kumar's mother, Jayanti Devi, volunteered to cook for the students while Anand Kumar, Abhayanand, and other teachers tutored them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5345100.stm|title=Helping poor Indians crack toughest test|date=2006-09-21|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> The students were also provided study materials and lodging for a year free of cost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2018/01/bihar-super-30-step-ladder-180115082525229.html|title=Bihar's Super 30: First step on the ladder|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref>

In the first year of the coaching, 18 out of 30 students made it to IIT. The following year, application numbers soared due to the popularity of the program and written examination was conducted to select 30 students. In 2004, 22 out of 30 students qualified for IIT-JEE, increasing the popularity of the program which attracted even more applications.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5zoCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT136&lpg=PT136&dq=super+30+in+first+year+18+out+of+30+students&source=bl&ots=hlfpFu2XMF&sig=y6A8bUMbMxArbAVnlWpcGoLbYt8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj09uSCuJzZAhUrx1kKHdwKDqEQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&q=super%2030%20in%20first%20year%2018%20out%20of%2030%20students&f=false|title=Dreams that Don’t Let You Sleep: Based on the Life Skills Management of Dr. Kalam|last='NISHANK'|first=DR RAMESH POKHRIYAL|date=2016-04-08|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books Pvt Ltd|isbn=9789385975882|language=en}}</ref>

In 2005, 26 out of 30 students cleared the [[Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced|IIT-JEE]] exam, while 28 in 2006 - this despite the fact that IIT changed the examination structure. In appreciation of their efforts, Bihar [[Chief Minister]] at the time [[Nitish Kumar]] congratulated the students with a cash prize of ₹50,000 each.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/CM-felicitates-Super-30-stars/articleshow/4605436.cms|title=CM felicitates Super-30 stars - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref>

The following year 28 more students cleared the IIT-JEE, and in 2008, all of the Super 30 students cleared the IIT-JEE, after which Abhayanand quit Super 30 saying "the experiment is over."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Cop-quits-Super-30-says-experiment-is-over/articleshow/3115540.cms|title=Cop quits Super-30, says the experiment is over  - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref> Some of Kumar's former students joined as Super 30 teachers and in 2009 and 2010 all 30 students again qualified the IIT JEE exams.  In subsequent years the success rates from the 30 students were: 2011 (24 passed), 2012 (27 passed), 2013 (28 passed), 2014 (27 passed), 2015 (25 passed), and in 2016 (28 passed).
