After graduating from the Film and Television Institute of India, Mehta joined the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] as a television producer. There, he was given almost total freedom in what to create. In an interview years later, Mehta remarked about how influential this was to his development: “It was an incredible experience. Traveling all over Gujarat, meeting people, making programs on whatever you felt like, whatever you came across. It was real, genuine experimentation with medium, with people. That experience has been vital to films that I’ve made.”<ref>Meer, Ameena http://bombsite.com/issues/29/articles/1262 Fall 1989, Retrieved 13 May 2013</ref>

Mehta's first film, ''[[Bhavni Bhavai]]'', a [[Gujarati film]], won him acclaim. His movies have been selected for various international film festivals such as [[Nantes]] (France) and the Moscow Film Festival, where they have won numerous awards over the years. ''[[Mirch Masala]]'' was one of Mehta's notable efforts, and won him the Best Film Award at Hawaii.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0576559/awards|title=Awards|publisher=IMDB}}</ref> It was released to 52 cinemas in the United States. Mehta has also had the honour of serving as a member of the jury in various national and international film festivals.

He directed a biopic ''[[Sardar (1993 film)|Sardar]]'', on the life of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], in 1993.
His latest two films ''[[Rang Rasiya]]'', 2014 and ''[[Manjhi the Mountain Man]]'', 2015 both opened to tepid box office and universally positive critical reviews. ''Manjhi the Mountain Man'' starred [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]].
