'''Randeep Hooda''' ({{lang-hi|रणदीप हुड्डा}}, {{IPA-hns|rɳd̪iːp huːɖaː|pron}}; born 20 August 1976) is an Indian actor and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]].  Best known for his work in the [[Hindi film industry]], he is the recipient of accolades such as two [[Stardust Awards]] and a nomination each for the [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfare]] and the [[International Indian Film Academy Awards]].

Born in [[Rohtak]], [[Haryana]] in a Jat family , Hooda studied at the [[Motilal Nehru School of Sports]], where he began acting in school productions. He later pursued a postgraduate degree in [[human resource management]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, and on his return to India began modelling and acting in theatre productions. He made his Hindi film debut with [[Mira Nair]]'s ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'' (2001). However, little recognition came his way and he went on to appear in a spate of critically and commercially unsuccessful projects including ''[[D (film)|D]]'' (2005) and ''[[Karma Aur Holi]]'' (2009) 

A turning point in his career came when Hooda starred in the commercially successful ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai]]'' (2010), and was subsequently noted for his performance in ''[[Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster]]'' (2011), which earned him an [[IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actor]] nomination. His starring roles in thrillers ''[[Jannat 2 ]]'' (2012) and ''[[Jism 2]]'' (2012) sustained him success at the box-office as he continued to garner praise for his performances in such films as the road drama ''[[Highway (2014 Hindi film)|Highway]]'' (2014) and the biopics ''[[Rang Rasiya]]'' (2014) and ''[[Sarbjit (film)|Sarbjit]]'' (2016).

In addition to his film career, Hooda has acted in numerous stage plays and had made his debut as a [[playwright]] with an adaptation of [[Lee Blessing]]'s ''[[A Walk in the Woods (play)|A Walk in the Woods]]''. He is also a professional [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] who regularly participates in [[polo]], [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]] events. He won a silver medal at an open dressage event in [[New Delhi]] that was organised by the [[Equestrian sport in India|Equestrian Federation of India]].
