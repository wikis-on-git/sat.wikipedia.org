The '''Mongols''' ({{lang-mn|Монголчууд, {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯᠴᠤᠳ}}}}, ''Mongolchuud'', {{IPA-mn|ˈmɔŋ.ɢɔɮ.t͡ʃʊːt|}}) are an [[East Asian people|East Asian]] ethnic group [[Indigenous peoples|native]] to [[Mongolia]] and to [[China]]'s [[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]]. They also live as minorities in other regions of China (e.g. [[Xinjiang]]), as well as in [[Russia]]. Mongolian people belonging to the [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] subgroups live predominantly in the Russian federal subjects of [[Buryatia]] and [[Kalmykia]].

The Mongols are bound together by a common heritage and [[ethnic identity]]. Their indigenous dialects are collectively known as the [[Mongolian language]]. The ancestors of the modern-day Mongols are referred to as [[Proto-Mongols]].

== Definition ==
Broadly defined, the term includes the Mongols proper (also known as the [[Khalkha Mongols]]), [[Buryats]], [[Oirats]], the [[Kalmyk people]] and the Southern Mongols. The latter comprises the [[Abaga Mongols]], [[Abaganar]], [[Aohans]], [[Baarins]], [[Gorlos Mongols]], [[Jalaids]], [[Jaruud]], [[Khishigten]], [[Khuuchid]], [[Muumyangan]] and [[Onnigud]].

The designation "Mongol" briefly appeared in 8th century records of [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] to describe a tribe of [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. It resurfaced in the late 11th century during the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty]]. After the fall of the Liao in 1125, the [[Khamag Mongol]]s became a leading tribe on the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. However, their wars with the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Tatar confederation]] had weakened them.

In the thirteenth century, the word Mongol grew into an umbrella term for a large group of [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic-speaking]] tribes united under the rule of [[Genghis Khan]].<ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia
