===Citizenship===
Sometime during or after the [[2011 Canadian federal election]], the [[Conservative Party (Canada)|Conservative]] government there granted Canadian citizenship to Kumar by invoking a little-known law which allowed circumventing the usual residency requirement for Canadian immigrants.<ref name=National-Post-21-May-2019/>  According to a former Conservative Party minister, [[Tony Clement]], the citizenship was awarded in return for Kumar's offer of putting his "star power to use to advance Canada-Indian relations," and Canada's "trade relations, commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector."<ref name=National-Post-21-May-2019/>  Although Kumar had earlier appeared in a campaign event for Conservative Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] in [[Brampton]], [[Ontario]], a city with a large Indo-Canadian population, and praised Harper, Clement denied that the citizenship was a reward for partisan support.<ref name=National-Post-21-May-2019>{{citation|last=Blackwell|first=Tom|date=21 May 2019|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/bollywood-actor-who-campaigned-for-stephen-harper-was-granted-canadian-citizenship-by-conservative-government|title=Bollywood actor who campaigned for Stephen Harper was granted Canadian citizenship by Conservative government|publisher=National Post|access-date=29 May 2020|quote="In the thick of the 2011 federal election, Stephen Harper appeared in the Indo-Canadian heartland of Ontario with a ringer. At a campaign stop in Brampton, Bollywood mega-star Akshay Kumar praised the then prime minister, danced on stage with his wife, Laureen Harper, and thrilled the audience. And at some point, the Harper government invoked a little-known law to grant the actor Canadian citizenship, circumventing the usual, stringent residency requirements for would-be Canadians, says a former Conservative cabinet minister.  MP Tony Clement, who as industry minister met with Kumar in Mumbai, says the citizenship grant was just a thank you for the actor’s help in promoting Canadian tourism and trade to a huge emerging economy – not a reward for partisan support. 'Basically, he had offered to put that star power to use to advance Canada-India relations, our trade relations, our commercial relations, in the movie sector, in the tourism sector,' said Clement."}}</ref>   Kumar had received an honorary doctorate degree from the [[University of Windsor]], and in a 2010 interview with the ''Economist'' claimed he had "dual citizenship."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Q&A: Akshay Kumar, Bollywood ambassador|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2010/10/indian_cinema|accessdate=23 June 2017|work=The Economist}}</ref>  He was one of the 15 international celebrities invited for the Olympics torch-bearer rally to Canada.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/Akshay-Kumars-fitness-mantra/articleshow/9440429.cms |title=Akshay Kumar's fitness mantra |work=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[The Times Group]] |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=2 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224195125/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/Akshay-Kumars-fitness-mantra/articleshow/9440429.cms|archivedate=24 December 2011}}</ref>
