==Publishing range==

BBT books range in complexity from brief, introductory volumes and study guides, summary studies, biographical material <ref>{{cite book | first = Dasa Goswami | last = Satsvarupa| title =Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta Vol 1-2| publisher = BBT| origyear=1980-82 |year=2002 | pages = vol.1 1133 pages vol.2 1191 pages | isbn = 978-0-89213-357-4 | nopp = true}}</ref> and short Sanskrit works all the way up to exhaustive multi-volume translations (with commentaries) of major Sanskrit and Bengali works. Its publications include original scriptural works, translated into more than 80 languages, and books that discuss and explain these traditional texts. The BBT also publishes audio books, audio CDs, video materials, and multimedia presentations.

The BBT publishes the ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is|Bhagavad Gita]], [[Bhagavata purana|Srimad-Bhagavatam]], [[Isha Upanishad|Isopanishad]], [[Narada Bhakti Sutra]],'' and (from the Gaudiya devotional tradition) the ''Sri [[Chaitanya Charitamrita]],'' and numerous other books. Its latest multi-volume publication is an English translation, with commentary, of [[Sanatana Goswami]]'s ''[[Brihad Bhagavatamrita]].''

The BBT publishes in all the major Eastern and Western European languages, in the major Indian languages, in the main languages of the former Soviet Union, and in  Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Singhalese, Hebrew, Persian, and other languages.

Apart from the BBT's work in publishing, it helps finance the construction and renovation of Krishna temples—for example, in the most important Gaudiya Vaishnava holy places like [[Vrindavan]] and [[Mayapur]].

==Structure==
The BBT has six main publishing divisions: North European, North American, Western Pacific, Mediterranean, African, and Indian. Every division is headed by a trustee, each responsible for publishing in the languages specific to that division. The trustees meet twice a year.
