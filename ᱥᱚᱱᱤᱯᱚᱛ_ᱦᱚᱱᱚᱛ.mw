==Origin of name==
The district is named after its administrative headquarters, Sonipat. Sonipat was earlier known as ''Sonprastha'', which later became ''[[Swarnprastha]]'' (Golden City), which is derived from two [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words, ''Svarna'' (Gold) and ''Prastha'' (Place). Over a period of time, the classical name [[Swarnprastha]]'s pronunciation degraded into ''Svarnpat'', and then to its current form, ''Sonipat''. The earliest reference of this city comes in the epic [[Mahabharata]], and at that time, it was one of the five villages demanded by the [[Pandavas]] in lieu of the kingdom of [[Hastinapur]].

==History==
This district was carved out of the erstwhile [[Rohtak district]] on 22 December 1972.

==Geography==
Broadly speaking, the entire district is a part of the Punjab plain, but the area is not level in some parts. Over most of the district, the soil is fine loam of rich colour. However, some areas have sandy soil and others Kallar. The plain has a gradual slope to the south and east. The district may be roughly divided into three regions: The Khadar, the upland plain and the sandy region.
