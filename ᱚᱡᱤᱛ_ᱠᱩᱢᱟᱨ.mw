==Acting career==

===1990–99===
Ajith did not speak Tamil as a child as he practiced Sindhi by his mother instead of Tamil, and mastered it only after becoming an actor. Aged 19, Ajith began his acting career and appeared in a song in ''[[En Veedu En Kanavar]]'' (1990). Later, Ajith was selected by the Telugu film production company Lakshmi Productions, to star in its film; however, the shooting was stalled soon after filming began, following the death of the film's director.<ref name="cancel">{{cite web |author=Warrier, Shobha |title=Bad back, great future |publisher=[[Rediff]] |date=6 April 1997 |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/jul/06aji.htm |access-date=29 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214954/http://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/jul/06aji.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Ajith then appeared in the low budget [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Prema Pustakam]]'' in 1992, which remains his last direct Telugu film to date. His first Tamil film ''[[Amaravathi (1993 film)|Amaravathi]]'', directed by then-newcomer [[Selva (director)|Selva]], was a moderate success and his voice was rendered by fellow actor [[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]].<ref name="dropout"/> After the release and while training for an amateur motor race, Ajith suffered a fall, injuring his back and underwent three major surgeries resulting in bed rest for one and a half years.<ref name="cancel"/> Following the injury in 1993, Ajith played a small role in the [[Arvind Swamy]] starrer ''[[Paasamalargal]]'', before appearing in a supporting lead role in the family drama ''[[Pavithra]]'', which featured him as an ailing patient shown maternal affection from [[Raadhika]].<ref name="pavi">{{cite web|author=Vijayan, K.|title=Many flaws in this sentimental attempt|work=[[New Straits Times]]|date=19 December 1994|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IG8WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3164,3956753&dq=ajith+pavithra}}</ref>

In 1995, after playing the second lead role in the [[Joseph Vijay|Vijay]] starrer ''[[Rajavin Parvaiyile]]'', Ajith appeared in his first major success: ''[[Aasai]]''. The film, directed by [[Vasanth]] and produced by [[Mani Ratnam]] featured him in the lead role opposite [[Suvalakshmi]], whose brother-in-law infatuates about her.

After the success of his films in 1996, the following year saw a series of five classical successes, one such being [[Amitabh Bachchan]]'s Tamil production ''[[Ullaasam]]'', with [[Maheswari]], in which he was paid a salary of {{INRConvert|2|m|year=1996}} for the first time.<ref name="dropout"/> Ajith returned in 1998 with another big, successful project in [[Saran (director)|Saran]]'s ''[[Kaadhal Mannan]]'', an action romantic comedy, setting the foundation for an expanding fan base.<ref name="dropout"/> He also began acting in [[Vasanth]]'s ''[[Nerukku Ner]]'', and was later replaced by [[Suriya (actor)|Suriya]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2000/jul/21spice.htm|title=Yukta signs her first film|publisher=[[Rediff]]|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=9 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516053658/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2000/jul/21spice.htm|archive-date=16 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The following films ''[[Aval Varuvala]]'' and ''[[Unnidathil Ennai Koduthen]]'' also became successes, with the latter featuring Ajith in a guest role. Except for ''[[Uyirodu Uyiraga]]'', which performed poorly, his other three films released in 1998 and six in 1999 were box office hits. [[Ramesh Khanna]]'s ''[[Thodarum]]'' and [[Sundar C]]'s romantic drama ''[[Unnaithedi]]'' opposite [[Malavika (Tamil actress)|Malavika]] set the tone for a series of big successes.

===1999–2007===
