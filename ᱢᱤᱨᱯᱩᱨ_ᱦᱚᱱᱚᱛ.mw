==History==
[[File:Pakistan - Azad Kashmir - Mirpur (division).svg|thumb|right|200px|The present day [[Mirpur Division]] (shown in red) is roughly coterminus with the Mirpur district of 1947]]

During the [[British Raj|British colonial times]], Mirpur was one of the five districts of the Jammu province in the [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]].{{sfn|Karim, Kashmir The Troubled Frontiers|2013|pp=29-32}}{{sfn|Behera, Demystifying Kashmir|2007|p=15}}  According to the 1941 census, the it had a population of 386,655, roughly 80% of whom were Muslim and 16% were Hindu.{{sfn|Snedden|2001|p=118}} It consisted of three ''tehsils'': [[Kotli district|Kotli]], Mirpur and [[Bhimber District|Bhimber]].{{sfn|Snedden|2001|p=112}} Kotli and Bhimber have since been made into separate districts. The three districts constitute the present day [[Mirpur Division]] in the [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]]. Small portions of the erstwhile Mirpur district are also included in the [[Rajouri district]] in the [[Indian-administered Kashmir]].

The original Mirpur district, along with the districts of [[History of Poonch District|Poonch]] and [[Rajouri district|Rajouri]], had close geographic, ethnic and cultural connections with [[Punjab, Pakistan|West Punjab]], more so than with the [[Jammu]] city and the rest of the Jammu province. Due to these reasons, scholar [[Christopher Snedden]] states that the people of Mirpur had a strong desire to join Pakistan during the [[Partition of India]].{{sfn|Snedden|2001|p=120}}
