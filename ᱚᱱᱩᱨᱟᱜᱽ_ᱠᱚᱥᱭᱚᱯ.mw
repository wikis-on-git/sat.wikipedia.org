'''Anurag Kashyap''' (born 10 September 1972) is an Indian film director, writer, editor, producer, actor known for his works in [[Hindi cinema]]. He is the recipient of several accolades, including four [[Filmfare Awards]]. For his contributions to film, the [[Government of France]] awarded him the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] (Knight of the Order of [[Arts and letters]]) in 2013.

After writing a television serial, Kashyap got his major break as a co-writer in [[Ram Gopal Varma]]'s crime drama ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'' (1998), and made his directorial debut with ''[[Paanch]]'', which never had a theatrical release due to censorship issues. He then went on to direct ''[[Black Friday (2007 film)|Black Friday]]'' (2007), a film based on the [[Black Friday: The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts|namesake book]] by [[Hussain Zaidi]] about the [[1993 Bombay bombings]]. Its release was held up for two years by the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] because of the pending verdict of the case at that time, but was released in 2007 to widespread critical appreciation. Kashyap's followup, ''[[No Smoking (2007 film)|No Smoking]]'' (2007) met with negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office. His next venture ''[[Dev.D]]'' (2009), a modern adaptation of [[Devdas]] was a critical and commercial success; followed by the political drama ''[[Gulaal (film)|Gulaal]]'' (2009), and the thriller ''[[That Girl in Yellow Boots]]'' (2011).

Kashyap's prominence increased with the two-part [[Crime film|crime drama]], ''[[Gangs of Wasseypur]]'' (2012). Kashyap subsequently co-produced the critically acclaimed drama ''[[The Lunchbox]]'', and the biographical drama ''[[Shahid (film)|Shahid]]'' (both 2013), the former earned him a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] nomination. His next films were the anthology ''[[Bombay Talkies (film)|Bombay Talkies]]'' (2013), and the drama ''[[Ugly (film)|Ugly]]'' (2014). In 2016, Kashyap directed ''[[Raman Raghav 2.0]]'', a film based on the serial killer [[Raman Raghav]]. His next film was the sports drama ''[[Mukkabaaz]]'', which was released in 2018. The same year, he co-directed India's first [[Netflix#Netflix Originals|Netflix Original series]], the crime thriller ''[[Sacred Games (TV series)|Sacred Games]]'', based on [[Vikram Chandra (novelist)|Vikram Chandra]]'s [[Sacred Games (novel)|novel of the same name]] and the romantic drama ''[[Manmarziyaan]]''. He is the co-founder of a film production company, Good Bad Films. In the past, he was the co-founder of two companies, [[Anurag Kashyap Films]] and [[Phantom Films]], both were dissolved.
