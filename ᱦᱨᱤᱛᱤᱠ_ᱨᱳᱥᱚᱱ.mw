'''Hrithik Roshan''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|'|r|ɪ|t|ɪ|k|_|'|r|ɒ|ʃ|ə|n}}, born 10 January 1974) is an Indian actor who appears in [[Bollywood]] films. He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won [[List of awards and nominations received by Hrithik Roshan|many awards]], including six [[Filmfare Awards|Filmfares]], four for [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and one each for [[Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut|Best Debut]] and [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor|Best Actor (Critics)]]. Starting in 2012, he appeared in ''[[Forbes India]]''{{'s}} [[Celebrity 100]] based on his income and popularity.

Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, [[Rakesh Roshan]]. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an [[assistant director]] on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success ''[[Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai]]'' (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama ''[[Fiza]]'' and the 2001 ensemble melodrama ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films.

The 2003 science fiction film ''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'', for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was a turning point in his career; he also appeared in its sequels: ''[[Krrish]]'' (2006) and ''[[Krrish 3]]'' (2013). He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in the 2006 adventure film ''[[Dhoom 2]]'', [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] in the 2008 historical romance ''[[Jodhaa Akbar]]'' and a [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]] in the 2010 drama ''[[Guzaarish (2010 film)|Guzaarish]]''. He played the lead in the 2011 drama ''[[Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara]]'', the 2012 revenge film ''[[Agneepath (2012 film)|Agneepath]]'', the 2014 action comedy ''[[Bang Bang!]]'', the 2019 biopic ''[[Super 30 (film)|Super 30]]'', and the 2019 action thriller ''[[War (2019 film)|War]]''. The lattermost ranks as his highest-grossing release.

Roshan has also performed on stage and debuted on television with ''[[Just Dance (Indian TV series)|Just Dance]]'' (2011). As a judge on the latter, he became the highest-paid film star on Indian television. He is involved with a number of humanitarian causes, endorses several brands and products and has launched his own clothing line. Roshan was married for fourteen years to [[Sussanne Khan]], with whom he has two children.
