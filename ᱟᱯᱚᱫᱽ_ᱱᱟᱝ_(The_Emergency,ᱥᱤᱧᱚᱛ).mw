For much of the Emergency, most of Indira Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned and the press was [[censorship|censored]]. Several other [[human rights]] violations were reported from the time, including a mass [[forced sterilization]] campaign spearheaded by [[Sanjay Gandhi]], the Prime Minister's son.  The Emergency is one of the most controversial periods of [[History of the Republic of India|independent India's history]].

The final decision to impose an emergency was proposed by Indira Gandhi, agreed upon by the [[president of India]], and thereafter ratified by the cabinet and the parliament (from July to August 1975), based on the rationale that there were imminent internal and external threats to the Indian state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Indira Gandhi |url=https://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/indira-gandhi-interview-tv-eye-1978-585652e6031fe-290724.html |website=Interview relecast through India times |publisher=TV Eye |accessdate=14 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=recallign the emergency |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/recalling-the-emergency-1975-77-the-emergency-at-work/ |accessdate=14 June 2018 |publisher=Indian Express |date=29 June 2015}}</ref>

==Proclamation of the Emergency==
The Government cited threats to national security, as a war with Pakistan had recently been concluded.  Due to the war and additional challenges of drought and the [[1973 oil crisis]], the economy was in poor condition. The Government claimed that the strikes and protests had paralysed the government and hurt the economy of the country greatly. In the face of massive political opposition, desertion and disorder across the country and the party, Gandhi stuck to the advice of a few loyalists and her younger son [[Sanjay Gandhi]], whose own power had grown considerably over the last few years to become an "extra-constitutional authority". [[Siddhartha Shankar Ray]], the [[Chief Minister of West Bengal]], proposed to the prime minister to impose an "internal emergency". He drafted a letter for the President to issue the proclamation based on information Indira had received that "there is an imminent danger to the security of India being threatened by internal disturbances". He showed how democratic freedom could be suspended while remaining within the ambit of the Constitution.<ref>NAYAR, KULDIP (25 June 2000).

After a quick question regarding a procedural matter, President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declared a [[the State of Emergency in India|state of internal emergency]] upon the prime minister's advice on the night of 25 June 1975, just a few minutes before the clock struck midnight.

As the constitution requires, Mrs Gandhi advised and President Ahmed approved the continuation of Emergency over every six months until she decided to hold [[1977 Indian general election|elections in 1977]].
