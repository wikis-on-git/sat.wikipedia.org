Ambani later enrolled for an [[MBA]] at [[Stanford University]] but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/jan/17inter.htm|title=Always invest in businesses of future and in talent|work=Rediff Business – Interview with Mukesh Ambani, 2007|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref>  His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.<ref name=":1" />

Ambani has been quoted as saying that he was influenced by his teachers [[William F.

== Career ==
In 1981 he started to help his father Dhirubhai Ambani run their family business, Reliance Industries Limited. By this time, it had already expanded so that it also dealt in refining and [[petrochemical]]s. The business also included products and services in retail and telecommunications industries. [[Reliance Retail]] Ltd., another subsidiary, is also the largest [[retailer]] in India.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/Ambani-becomes-india-s-top-retailer-as-biyani-slips-post-demerger-113081600179_1.html|title=Ambani tops retailer list, too|work=Business Standard|date=17 August 2013|accessdate=19 August 2013|last1=Kumar|first1=Abhineet}}</ref> Reliance's [[Jio]] has earned a top-five spot in the country's telecommunication services since its public launch on 5 September 2016.

==Timeline==
=== 1980s – 1990s ===
In 1980, the Indian government under [[Indira Gandhi]] opened PFY (polyester filament yarn) manufacturing to the private sector. Dhirubhai Ambani applied for a license to set up a PFY manufacturing plant. Obtaining the license was a long-drawn-out process requiring a strong connection within the bureaucracy system because the government, at the time, was restricting large-scale manufacturing, making the importation of yarn for the textiles impossible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://spontaneousorder.in/india-before-1991-stories-of-life-under-the-license-raj-bfd108e6055b|title=India Before 1991: Stories of Life Under the License Raj|date=30 March 2016|work=Spontaneous Order|access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref> In spite of stiff competition from Tatas, Birlas and 43 others, Dhirubhai was awarded the license, more commonly addressed as [[Licence Raj|License Raj]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/78/Reliance-Industries-Ltd.html|title=Reliance Industries – Company Profile|work=Reliance Industries Ltd. – Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Reliance Industries Ltd.

Ambani did not return to his university program, leading Reliance's backward integration, where companies own their suppliers to generate more revenue and improve efficiency, in 1981 from textiles into polyester fibers and further into petrochemicals, which the yarns were made from.<ref name="aboutus2"/> After joining the company, he reported daily to Rasikbhai Meswani, then executive director. The company was being built from scratch with the principle of everybody contributing to the business and not heavily depend on selected individuals.
