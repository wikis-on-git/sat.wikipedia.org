Ambani later enrolled for an [[MBA]] at [[Stanford University]] but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2007/jan/17inter.htm|title=Always invest in businesses of future and in talent|work=Rediff Business – Interview with Mukesh Ambani, 2007|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref>  His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.<ref name=":1" />
