In 2010, after an injury that required surgery to her tailbone, Abro's doctor warned her not to dance. Because she had promised to perform a dance at her school, however, Abro performed sitting on the edge of the stage, just moving her hands and face, earning applause from the audience.<ref name="WWeb"/>

Abro was diagnosed with [[epilepsy]] in her late teens.<ref name="Newsline2018"/>

Having already performed in many music videos, Abro gave her first public solo performance in 2011, at Karachi's [[The Second Floor|T2F]], at an evening of some of her mother's poetry.<ref name="WWeb"/><ref name = "Dawn2011"/>
