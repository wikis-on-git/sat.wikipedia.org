'''Anantavarman Chodaganga''' ({{reign|1077|1150}}{{cn|date=May 2017}}) was a ruler of the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] which ruled the southern part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], [[India]]. He was the son of Rajaraja Devendravarman and Rajasundari, the daughter of emperor [[Virarajendra Chola]]. The Chola king [[Kulothunga Chola I]] of the [[Chola dynasty]] was his uncle. However, historian S.N. Sen states that Anantavarman was the maternal grandson of Kulottunga I. The [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] at [[Puri]] was rebuilt in the 11th century<ref name="sen">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=36–37}}</ref> atop its ruins by Anantavarman Chodaganga.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.asianart.com/articles/patachitra/index.html#4 |title=Bernard Cesarone: Pata-chitras of Orissa |first=Bernard |last= Cesarone|work=asianart.com |year=2012 |quote=This temple was built between approximately 1135-1150 by Codaganga |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>

King Chodaganga was originally a [[Shaivite]] from [[Srimukhalingam]](which was in Kalinga/Odisha till 1934,as part of Undivided Ganjam District) but embraced [[Sri Vaishnavism]] under the influence of [[Ramanuja|Sri Ramanuja]] when the latter visited the Jagannath Puri temple.<ref>{{cite book|title=Orissa Review, Volume 44|author=Orissa (India).

Historians propose that it was probably because the king failed to pay his rent for two consecutive years. He was ousted by Kulothunga's general Karunakara Thondaiman and this victory is detailed in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] classic ''Kalingattupparani''. Monarchs from this region of the subcontinent regularly assumed the title Chodaganga Deva throughout the ancient and medieval periods to allude to their [[Chola]] and Ganga heritage

From various inscriptions it is known that King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva established the present temple some time near the end of the eleventh century. A copper plate inscription made by King Rajaraja III found on the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]] near the north entrance states that Jagannath temple was built by Gangesvara, i.e., Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva.

Later, King Ananga Bhima Deva II (1170–1198) did much to continue the work of Chodaganga Deva, building the walls around the temple and many of the other shrines on the temple grounds. He is thus often considered one of the builders of the temple. He also did much to establish the regulations around the service to the Deity.

A scion of this dynasty made rich donations to the [[Koneswaram temple]], [[Trincomalee]] on [[Puthandu]], 1223 CE in the name of King Chodaganga Deva. Shortly afterwards, the [[Konark temple]] was constructed in Odisha. A brother of the king titled Ulagaikonda Permadi is known to us from several inscriptions.<ref>{{cite book|title=Epigraphia Indica, Volume 30|author=Archaeological Survey of India, India.
