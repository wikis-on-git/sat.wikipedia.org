The '''Provinces of India''', earlier '''Presidencies of British India''' and still earlier, '''Presidency towns''', were the administrative divisions of British governance in [[India]]. Collectively, they were called '''British India'''. In one form or another, they existed between 1612 and 1947, conventionally divided into three historical periods:

*Between 1612 and 1757 the [[East India Company]] set up [[Factory (trading post)|"factories" (trading posts)]] in several locations, mostly in coastal India, with the consent of the [[Mughal emperors]] or local rulers. Its rivals were the merchant trading companies of Portugal, Denmark, the Netherlands, and France. By the mid-18th century three ''Presidency towns'': [[Madras]], [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]], had grown in size.
*During the period of [[Company rule in India]], 1757–1858, the Company gradually acquired sovereignty over large parts of India, now called "Presidencies". However, it also increasingly came under British government oversight, in effect sharing sovereignty with the Crown. At the same time, it gradually lost its mercantile privileges.
*Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the Company's remaining powers were transferred to the Crown. Under the [[British Raj]] (1858–1947), administrative boundaries were extended to include a few other British-administered regions, such as [[Upper Burma]]. Increasingly, however, the unwieldy presidencies were broken up into "Provinces".<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1908|p=5}} Quote: "The history of British India falls ... into three periods. From the beginning of the 17th to the middle of the 18th century, the East India Company is a trading corporation, existing on the sufferance of the native powers, and in rivalry with the merchant companies of Holland and France. During the next century, the Company acquires and consolidates its dominion, shares its sovereignty in increasing proportions with the Crown, and gradually loses its mercantile privileges and functions. After the Mutiny of 1857, the remaining powers of the Company are transferred to the Crown ..."</ref>
