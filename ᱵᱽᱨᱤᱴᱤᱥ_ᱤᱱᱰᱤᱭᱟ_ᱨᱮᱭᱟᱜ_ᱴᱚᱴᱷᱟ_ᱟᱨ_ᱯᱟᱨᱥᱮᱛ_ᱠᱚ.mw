The '''Provinces of India''', earlier '''Presidencies of British India''' and still earlier, '''Presidency towns''', were the administrative divisions of British governance in [[India]]. Collectively, they were called '''British India'''. In one form or another, they existed between 1612 and 1947, conventionally divided into three historical periods:

*Between 1612 and 1757 the [[East India Company]] set up [[Factory (trading post)|"factories" (trading posts)]] in several locations, mostly in coastal India, with the consent of the [[Mughal emperors]] or local rulers. Its rivals were the merchant trading companies of Portugal, Denmark, the Netherlands, and France. By the mid-18th century three ''Presidency towns'': [[Madras]], [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]], had grown in size.
*During the period of [[Company rule in India]], 1757–1858, the Company gradually acquired sovereignty over large parts of India, now called "Presidencies". However, it also increasingly came under British government oversight, in effect sharing sovereignty with the Crown. At the same time, it gradually lost its mercantile privileges.
*Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the Company's remaining powers were transferred to the Crown. Under the [[British Raj]] (1858–1947), administrative boundaries were extended to include a few other British-administered regions, such as [[Upper Burma]]. Increasingly, however, the unwieldy presidencies were broken up into "Provinces".<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1908|p=5}} Quote: "The history of British India falls ... into three periods. From the beginning of the 17th to the middle of the 18th century, the East India Company is a trading corporation, existing on the sufferance of the native powers, and in rivalry with the merchant companies of Holland and France. During the next century, the Company acquires and consolidates its dominion, shares its sovereignty in increasing proportions with the Crown, and gradually loses its mercantile privileges and functions. After the Mutiny of 1857, the remaining powers of the Company are transferred to the Crown ..."</ref>

In 1608, [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] authorities allowed the English East India Company to establish a small trading settlement at [[Surat]] (now in the state of [[Gujarat]]), and this became the company's first headquarters town. It was followed in 1611 by a permanent [[factory (trading post)|factory]] at [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]], and in 1612 the company joined other already established [[East India Company (disambiguation)|European trading companies]] in [[Bengal]] in trade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=452–472}}</ref> However, the power of the Mughal Empire declined from 1707, first at the hands of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]]s and later due to invasion from Persia (1739) and Afghanistan (1761); after the East India Company's victories at the [[Battle of Plassey]] (1757) and [[Battle of Buxar]] (1764)—both within the [[Bengal Presidency]] established in 1765—and the abolition of local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal in 1793, the Company gradually began to formally expand its territories across [[India]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=473–487}}</ref> By the mid-19th century, and after the three [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] the East India Company had become the paramount political and military power in south Asia, its territory held in [[Trust law|trust]] for the [[The Crown|British Crown]].<ref name=igi-ii-pp488-514>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=488–514}}</ref>

Company rule in Bengal (after 1793) was terminated by the [[Government of India Act 1858]], following the events of the Bengal [[Rebellion of 1857]].<ref name=igi-ii-pp488-514/> Henceforth known as British India, it was thereafter directly ruled as a colonial possession of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and India was officially known after 1876 as the [[Indian Empire]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. II|1908|pp=514–530}}</ref> India was divided into [[British India]], regions that were directly administered by the British, with Acts established and passed in British Parliament,<ref name=igi-iv-pp46-57>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1908|pp=46–57}}</ref> and the [[Princely State]]s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1908|pp=58–103}}</ref> ruled by local rulers of different ethnic backgrounds. These rulers were allowed a measure of internal autonomy in exchange for recognition of British [[suzerainty]]. British India constituted a significant portion of India both in area and population; in 1910, for example, it covered approximately 54% of the area and included over 77% of the population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1908|pp=59–61}}</ref> In addition, there were [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and [[French India|French]] [[exclave]]s in India. Independence from British rule was achieved in 1947 with the formation of two nations, the [[Dominion]]s of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], the latter including [[East Bengal]], present-day [[Bangladesh]].

The term ''British India'' also applied to [[Burma]] for a shorter time period: beginning in 1824, a small part of Burma, and by 1886, almost two thirds of Burma had been made part of British India.<ref name=igi-iv-pp46-57/> This arrangement lasted until 1937, when Burma was reorganized as a separate British colony. ''British India'' did not apply to other countries in the region, such as [[Sri Lanka]] (then [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]]), which was a British [[Crown colony]], or the [[Maldive Islands]], which were a British [[Protectorate#Colonial protection|protectorate]]. At its greatest extent, in the early 20th century, the territory of British India extended as far as the frontiers of [[Persia]] in the west; [[Afghanistan]] in the northwest; [[Nepal]] in the north, [[Tibet]] in the northeast; and China, [[French Indochina]] and [[Siam]] in the east. It also included the [[Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden|Aden Province]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Imperial Gazetteer of India vol. IV|1908|pp=104–125}}</ref>
