===Film debut and breakthrough (2010–2014)===
[[File:Ranveer2.jpg|left|thumb|Singh at a promotional event for ''[[Band Baaja Baaraat]]'' in 2010|alt=Singh looking towards his left and smiling, wearing a black T-shirt]]
In January 2010, Singh was called for an audition by Shanoo Sharma, the head of the casting division for [[Yash Raj Films]].<ref name="star"/> They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled ''[[Band Baaja Baaraat]]'', a [[romantic comedy]] set in the world of [[wedding planner|wedding planning]]. [[Aditya Chopra]], the vice president of the company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film.<ref name="ndtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/article177227.ece |title=YRF launches new face with Anushka Sharma |publisher=[[New Indian Express]] |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223030326/http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/article177227.ece |archivedate=23 December 2013 |df= }}</ref> However, writer-director [[Maneesh Sharma]] needed some more convincing and he was called for a few more auditions over the next two weeks until the three were completely convinced of his caliber.<ref name="bhbio"/> After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with [[Anushka Sharma]] playing the female lead.<ref name="ndtv"/>

Singh described the role of Bittoo Sharma as a typical Delhi boy.<ref name="bhbio"/> To prepare for the role, he spent time with students at the [[University of Delhi|Delhi University]] campus.<ref name="glam"/> Prior to the release of the film, trade analysts were skeptical of the film's commercial potential, citing the middling response to [[Yash Raj Films]]' last few productions, the lack of a male [[Movie star|star]] and the fact that the female lead, Anushka Sharma, was by then an "almost-forgotten" actress.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dipti |last=Nagpaul D'souza |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Missing-the-mark/707404/ |title=Missing the mark |work=[[The Indian Express]] |publisher=[[Indian Express Group]] |date=5 November 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209180544/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Missing-the-mark/707404 |archivedate= 9 December 2010 |df= }}</ref> However, ''Band Baaja Baaraat'' went on to become a [[sleeper hit]].
