The rural urban ratio is 90:10. The majority of the rural population depends on [[agriculture]], [[livestock]] and [[forestry]] for its subsistence. Many people are working or settled abroad in the [[Middle East]], [[UK]] and [[United States]] and they support their families behind and in the development of the area. Hattian Bala is a mainly hilly and mountainous region with stretches of plains along the riverside, the river [[Jehlum]] which enters from the Chakothi LoC point and passes through the Jehlum valley flowing east to northwest. Due to fast flowing winding streams, Hattian Bala has great potential to generate [[hydroelectricity]]. Hydro power stations are [[Kathai]], Leepa, and Sharian. The district's natural environment includes valleys like Leepa, Khalana Chham, [[Ghail]], Saina Daman Chamm, Dhani Shahdarrah, Charoi, Chinari,jaskool, Chonoian, Bharyan (Lower Chonoian) and Chakar Salmia.{{fact|date=January 2019}}
