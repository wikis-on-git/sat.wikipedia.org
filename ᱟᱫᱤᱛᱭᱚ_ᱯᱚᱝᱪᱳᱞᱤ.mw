Pancholi began his career with television movies produced by Nari Hira and ventured into mainstream Bollywood cinema with ''Sasti Dulhan Mehnga Dulha'' (1986). Pancholi first came into the limelight with an important role in ''[[Maha-Sangram]]'' (1990). He had the peak of his career between the late 1980s and early 1990s. He succeeded by playing the second lead; most of his leading roles were not box office successes.

In 2019, actress [[Kangana Ranaut]], who had previously been in a relationship with him, filed a police complaint claiming that Pancholi had drugged, raped, assaulted and blackmailed her for sex repeatedly over a prolonged period starting in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/celebrities/story/aditya-pancholi-drugged-and-raped-me-inside-car-took-photos-to-blackmail-me-bollywood-actress-1561030-2019-07-03?amp_js_v=0.1&usqp=mq331AQCKAE= |work=India Today |date=3 July 2019 |title=Aditya Pancholi drugged and raped me inside car, took photos to blackmail me: Bollywood actress}}</ref> She repeated these claims in an interview to "[[Aap ki adalat|Aap ki Adalat]]" on [[India TV]] and cited an incident of assault which had occurred in public.

Eyewitnesses to the incident say that Pancholi stopped the [[rickshaw]] in which Ranaut was travelling, compelled her to get out of the vehicle and slapped her face.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kangana-ranaut-aditya-pancholi-physical-abuse-zarina-wahab/1/1039399.html|title=Kangana Ranaut names Aditya Pancholi as her abuser: I was a minor, went to his wife for help|access-date=2017-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903014600/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kangana-ranaut-aditya-pancholi-physical-abuse-zarina-wahab/1/1039399.html|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Pancholi stated in his defence that the accusations was false and as despicable as her entire relationship with him. He said that in fact, Ranaut had exploited him both financially and emotionally in a calculated manner and used his influence to secure a foothold for herself as an actress. The trial is yet to begin. Aditya Pancholi had earlier been accused of raping his ex-girlfriend [[Pooja Bedi]]'s 15-year-old maid during the time when he and Pooja were dating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/celebrity/the-story-of-aditya-pancholis-rape-case-and-illicit-affair-with-kangana-ranaut_136538.html|title=The story of Aditya Pancholi’s rape case and illicit affair with Kangana Ranaut|date=11 June 2013|website=Zeenews.india.com|access-date=1 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201193332/http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/celebrity/the-story-of-aditya-pancholis-rape-case-and-illicit-affair-with-kangana-ranaut_136538.html|archive-date=1 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, after a decade-long trial, a local metropolitan court in Mumbai found Aditya Pancholi guilty of assaulting a business associate in a fit of rage in 2005, and sentenced him to a one-year imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- (US$300). Pancholi has appealed against the judgment in a higher court. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/051116/aditya-pancholi-sentenced-to-one-year-imprisonment-in-2005-assault-case.html|title=Aditya Pancholi sentenced to one year imprisonment in 2005 assault case|date=5 November 2016|website=Deccanchronicle.com|accessdate=22 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823013756/https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/051116/aditya-pancholi-sentenced-to-one-year-imprisonment-in-2005-assault-case.html|archive-date=23 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
