'''Shahid Kapoor''' ({{IPA-hns|ʃaːɦɪd̪ kəˈpuːr|pron}}; born 25 February 1981), is an Indian actor who appears in [[Bollywood|Hindi films]]. Initially recognised for portraying romantic roles, he has since taken on parts in action films and thrillers, and is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Shahid Kapoor|several awards]], including three [[Filmfare Awards]].

The son of actors [[Pankaj Kapur]] and [[Neelima Azeem]], Kapoor was born in New Delhi. His parents separated when he was three, and he continued living with his mother. They moved to Mumbai when he was 10, where he joined [[Shiamak Davar]]'s dance academy. Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in a few films of the 1990s, and was later featured in music videos and television commercials. He made his film debut in 2003 with a leading role in the romantic comedy ''[[Ishq Vishk]]'', a [[sleeper hit]] for which he won a [[Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut]]. He followed it with roles in several commercial failures before starring in [[Sooraj Barjatya]]'s top-grossing family drama ''[[Vivah]]'' (2006).

Kapoor earned nominations for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]] for portraying a troubled businessman in [[Imtiaz Ali (director)|Imtiaz Ali]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Jab We Met]]'' (2007) and twin brothers in [[Vishal Bhardwaj]]'s thriller ''[[Kaminey]]'' (2009). After appearing in another series of unsuccessful films, he starred in the action film ''[[R... Rajkumar]]'' (2013). Kapoor received critical acclaim for portraying the [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] character in Bhardwaj's tragedy ''[[Haider (film)|Haider]]'' (2014) and a drug abusing singer in the crime drama ''[[Udta Punjab]]'' (2016). For the former, he won a Filmfare Award for Best Actor and for the latter, he won a [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]]. Kapoor's highest-grossing releases came with the period drama ''[[Padmaavat]]'' (2018) and the romantic drama ''[[Kabir Singh]]'' (2019).

In addition to acting, Kapoor supports charities, hosts award ceremonies, and has featured as a talent judge on the dance reality show ''[[Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa]] Reloaded'' (2015). He is married to the homemaker Mira Rajput, with whom he has two children.

[[File:Shahid Kapoor 2004.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Shahid Kapoor, wearing sunglasses, looks away from the camera|left|Kapoor in 2004]]
Having noticed Kapoor in the Aryans'  music video "Aankhon Mein", the producer [[Ramesh Taurani]] was keen to cast him in a film.<ref name="taurani">{{cite news|last=Gupta|first=Priya|title=What I liked about Shahid was his patience: Ramesh Taurani|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Phata-Poster-Nihkla-Hero-Shahid-Kapoor/articleshow/22761002.cms?|work=The Times of India|date=20 September 2013|accessdate=5 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103073608/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Phata-Poster-Nihkla-Hero-Shahid-Kapoor/articleshow/22761002.cms|archivedate=3 January 2018}}</ref> However, upon meeting him, Taurani thought Kapoor, who was 20 years old at the time, to be too young and underweight to become an actor, and encouraged him to wait for a few years.<ref name="toiinterview" /> Kapoor, meanwhile, turned down a lead role in [[N. Chandra]]'s sex comedy ''[[Style (2001 film)|Style]]'' in hopes of working with Taurani.<ref name="taurani" /> Taurani found a suitable project for Kapoor in the teenage romance ''[[Ishq Vishk]]'' (2003), which [[Ken Ghosh]] was directing for his company. Kapoor, who trained extensively for a bulkier physical build, was eventually hired.<ref name="taurani" /> Before beginning work on the film, he attended acting workshops with [[Naseeruddin Shah]] and [[Satyadev Dubey]].<ref name="smiles" />

''Ishq Vishk'' tells the story of Rajiv Mathur (Kapoor), a high-school student who engages in a romantic affair with two classmates of contrasting personalities (played by [[Amrita Rao]] and [[Shenaz Treasurywala]]). Kapoor was attracted to the idea of playing an unlikable lead since it was a departure from the traditional portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian films.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shahid, Shehnaz start Ishq Vishk with showbiz|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030518/spectrum/main5.htm|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075340/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030518/spectrum/main5.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Hindu]]'', the critic Ziya Us Salam did not find him to be "hero material", adding that "boyhood seems to have overstayed on his face {{ndash}} but he is not necessarily bad in the acting department."<ref>{{cite news|last=Us Salam|first=Ziya|title=Tears of the Sun for lovebirds|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/05/12/stories/2003051200550300.htm|work=The Hindu|date=12 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103073608/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/05/12/stories/2003051200550300.htm|archivedate=3 January 2018}}</ref> The film, however, proved to be a [[sleeper hit]] at the box office and won Kapoor the [[Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut]].<ref name="lalwani1">{{cite web|last=Lalwani|first=Vickey|title=I am not insecure about Kareena!|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/aug/18shahid.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|date=18 August 2004|accessdate=4 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619081223/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/aug/18shahid.htm|archivedate=19 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="ff">{{cite news|last=Khan|first=Ujala Ali|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-lifestyle/trophy-time-at-filmfare-awards|title=Trophy time at Filmfare Awards|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=27 January 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429190243/http://www.thenational.ae/arts-lifestyle/trophy-time-at-filmfare-awards|archivedate=29 April 2015}}</ref>

Following his debut, Kapoor reunited with Ghosh in a film he considered to be drastically different from ''Ishq Vishk''.<ref name="lalwani1" /> The thriller ''[[Fida]]'' (2004) featured him as a love-struck student who is manipulated by a woman ([[Kareena Kapoor]]) and her lover ([[Fardeen Khan]]) to rob a bank. Despite criticising the film, Rama Sharma of ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' wrote that Kapoor "shines in his role. He looks fresh. As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy, who is sucked into crime because of these very qualities, he manages to evoke your sympathies."<ref>{{cite news|author=Sharma, Rama|title=Don't go 'Fida' over this one|date=22 August 2004|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040822/cth2.htm#10|work=The Tribune|accessdate=17 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307102431/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040822/cth2.htm#10|archivedate=7 March 2016}}</ref> Later that year, Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy ''[[Dil Maange More]]'' in which he was paired opposite three women: [[Soha Ali Khan]], [[Tulip Joshi]], and [[Ayesha Takia]].
