Anuj studied in a Sanskrit-medium school. Nevertheless, he has five novels in the English language to his credit. Born and brought up in [[Bareilly]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], he dreamt of writing books but kept those dreams to himself for the fear of being mocked.
His Sanskrit was much better than his Hindi, and of course, than his English. His determination to impress someone led him to write his first book. It changed everything for him with his later books, which were inspirational and based on true stories. <ref>[https://www.indiatoday.in/pti-feed/story/small-town-sanksrit-speaking-boys-journey-to-becoming-english-novelist-1184705-2018-03-08], Dubai.</ref><ref>[https://www.sakaltimes.com/art-culture/there%E2%80%99s-spark-you-42387], SakalTimes.</ref> Anuj recently married his long-time girlfriend Anushka, also known as Sneha Panday.
