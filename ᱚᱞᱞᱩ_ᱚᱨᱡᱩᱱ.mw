[[File:Allu Arjun at Vaishali audio launch.jpg|thumb|Arjun at the audio launch of ''[[Eeram]]'']]

His next film was [[Bhaskar (director)|Bhaskar]]'s  ''[[Parugu]]'', where he played the role of Krishna, a happy-go-lucky man from Hyderabad who helps his friend to elope with his love, only to experience the wrath of the woman's father and the emotional struggle he felt. ''idlebrain.com'' wrote: "Allu Arjun is pretty excellent in the first half as the characterization in the first half is vibrant and needs loads of energy. He carried the entire first half on his shoulders. He excelled in the emotional scenes in the second half."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/archive/mr-parugu.html |title=Telugu Movie review – Parugu |publisher=idlebrain.com |accessdate=1 May 2008}}</ref>

''Sify'' wrote: "Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy caught in the powerful current of love.

His character in the movie has the qualities of a psychotic and he portrayed the character flawlessly. He shined in emotional scenes in the second half of the movie.

The movie completed a 50-day run in 187 centers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-03/news-interviews/29846171_1_badrinath-allu-arjun-theatres |title=Badrinath completes 50days in 187 theatres |work=The Times of India|accessdate=3 August 2011<!-- 12:08 PM IST-->}}</ref>

After ''Badrinath'', Arjun appeared in the film ''[[Julayi]]'', an action comedy released in 2012.

''The Times of India'' wrote: "Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic panache.

''The Times of India'' wrote: "True to his tag of "stylish star", Allu Arjun looks trendier than ever before. His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news-interviews/39654524_1_kecha-khamphakdee-puri-jagannath-movie-review |title=Iddarammayilatho Telugu movie review highlights |work=The Times of India|accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref>
