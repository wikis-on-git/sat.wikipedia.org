The Fort is built of brick and mortar in the shape of an irregular octagon with an area 5&nbsp;km². Five of its sides face landward, and three towards the [[Hooghly River]]. The design is that of a [[star fort]], suited to defence against cannon firing solid shot, and dates from before the advent of explosive shells. A dry [[moat]] 9 m deep and 15 m broad surrounds the fort. The moat can be flooded but is designed as an area in which to use [[enfilade]] (or "flanking") fire against any attackers reaching the walls. There are six gates: Chowringhee, Plassey, Calcutta, Water Gate, St Georges and the Treasury Gate. There are similar forts at places like [[Thalassery]] in [[Kerala]].<ref>Nandakumar Koroth, ''History of Forts in North Malabar''</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

{{Main|History of Kolkata}}
There are two Fort Williams. The original fort was built in the year 1696 by the [[British East India Company]] under the orders of [[John Goldsborough|Sir John Goldsborough]] which took a decade to complete. The permission was granted by [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]].<ref>Sudip Bhattacharya, Unseen Enemy: The English, Disease, and Medicine in Colonial Bengal, 1617 – 1847, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 30 Jun 2014, p.54</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.makemytrip.com/travel-guide/kolkata/fort-william-monuments.html|title=Fort William Kolkata India - History of Fort William|website=www.makemytrip.com|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> [[Charles Eyre|Sir Charles Eyre]] started construction near the bank of the [[Hooghly River]] with the South-East Bastion and the adjacent walls. It was named after [[King William III]] in 1700. [[John Beard (colonial administrator)|John Beard]], Eyre's successor, added the North-East Bastion in 1701, and in 1702 started the construction of the Government House ('''Factory''', see [[Factory (trading post)]]) at the centre of the fort. Construction ended in 1706. The original building had two stories and projecting wings. In 1756, the [[Nawab of Bengal]], [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], attacked the Fort, temporarily conquered the city, and changed its name to '''Alinagar'''. This led the British to build a new fort in the [[Maidan (Kolkata)|Maidan]].
