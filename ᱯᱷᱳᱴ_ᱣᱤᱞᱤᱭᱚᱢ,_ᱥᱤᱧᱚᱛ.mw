'''Fort William''' is a [[fort]] in [[Hastings, Kolkata|Hastings]], Calcutta ([[Kolkata]]). It was built during the early years of the [[Bengal Presidency]] of [[British India]]. It sits on the eastern banks of the [[Hooghly River]], the major distributary of the River [[Ganges]]. One of Kolkata's most enduring [[British Raj|Raj]]-era edifices, it extends over an area of 70.9 hectares.

The fort was named after [[William III of England|King William III]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Calcutta: A Cultural and Literary History|author= Krishna Dutta|year=2003|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UKfoHi5412UC&pg=PA71 |isbn= 9781902669595}}</ref> In front of the Fort is the [[Maidan (Kolkata)|Maidan]], the largest park in the city. An internal guard room became the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]].

The Fort is built of brick and mortar in the shape of an irregular octagon with an area 5&nbsp;km². Five of its sides face landward, and three towards the [[Hooghly River]]. The design is that of a [[star fort]], suited to defence against cannon firing solid shot, and dates from before the advent of explosive shells. A dry [[moat]] 9 m deep and 15 m broad surrounds the fort. The moat can be flooded but is designed as an area in which to use [[enfilade]] (or "flanking") fire against any attackers reaching the walls. There are six gates: Chowringhee, Plassey, Calcutta, Water Gate, St Georges and the Treasury Gate. There are similar forts at places like [[Thalassery]] in [[Kerala]].<ref>Nandakumar Koroth, ''History of Forts in North Malabar''</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}
