The secret killings of [[Assam]] (1998–2001) was probably the darkest chapter in Assam's political history when relatives, friends, sympathisers of [[ULFA]] insurgents were systematically killed by unknown assailants. These extra-judicial murders happened in [[Assam]] between 1998 and 2001.

During the government of AGP leader [[Prafulla Kumar Mahanta]], a number of family members of [[ULFA]] leaders were assassinated by unidentified gunmen. With the fall of this government following elections in 2001, the secret killings stopped. Investigations into the killings culminated in the report of the "Saika Commission", presented to the Assam Assembly November 15, 2007. The report provides details about the killings, which were organized by [[Prafulla Mahanta]] in his role as the Assam Home Minister, and executed by the police, with cooperation from the Indian Army. The actual killers were surrendered elements of the [[ULFA]], who would approach their targets at home, at night, knocking on the door and calling out in [[Assamese]] to allay suspicion. When the victims answered the door, they were shot or kidnapped to be shot elsewhere.
