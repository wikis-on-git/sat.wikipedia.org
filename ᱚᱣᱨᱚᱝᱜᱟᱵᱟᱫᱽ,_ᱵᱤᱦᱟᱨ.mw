Aurangabad is sometimes called the "[[Chittorgarh]] of [[Bihar]]" because of its large [[Rajput]] population of the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] lineage. Since the first Indian general elections in 1952, Aurangabad has only ever elected [[Rajput]] representatives.<ref>https://www.deccanherald.com/national/end-of-a-dynasty-in-chittorgarh-of-bihar-728009.html</ref>

In ancient times, Aurangabad was located in the [[Mahajanapada]] kingdom of [[Magadh]] (1200 - 322 BCE). The ancient rulers of the town included [[Bimbisara]] (late 5th century BCE), [[Ajatashatru]] (early 4th century BCE), [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (321 - 298 BCE) and [[Ashoka]] (268 - 232 BCE).

During the rule of [[Sher Shah Suri]] (1486 - 1545 CE), Aurangabad became strategically important as part of the Rohtas Sirkar (district). After the death of [[Sher Shah Suri]], Aurangabad fell under the rule of [[Akbar]]. The [[Afghan]] upsurge in the area was suppressed by [[Todar Mal]]. Some elements of [[Afghan]] architecture remain.

After the downfall of the [[Mughal Empire]], Aurangabad was ruled by the [[zamindar]]s- wealthy landowners, including those of [[Deo Raj]], Kutumba, Mali, Pawai, Chandragarh, and Siris. The [[zamindar]]s resisted British rule. For example, Fateh Narayan Singh of [[Deo Raj]], a [[Mewari]] [[Sisodia]] [[rajput]], supported [[Kunwar Singh]] against the British.

In 1865, Bihar District was separated from Patna District. Aurangabad was made a subdivision of Bihar district. Stement was the first subdivisional officer of Aurangabad subdivision. The first Member of Parliament from the district was the former [[Chief Minister of Bihar|Chief Minister of Unified Bihar]], Satyendra Narayan Singh (Chhote Saheb).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.in/bihar/parliamentary-constituencies/aurangabad.html|title=Aurangabad (Bihar) Lok Sabha Election Results 2014 with Sitting MP and Party Name|accessdate=15 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001051458/http://www.elections.in/bihar/parliamentary-constituencies/aurangabad.html|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 26 January 1973, [[Aurangabad district, Bihar]], was created (government notification number 07/11-2071-72 dated 19 January 1973). K. A. H. Subramanyam was the first district magistrate and Surjit Kumar Saha was the sub-divisional officer.
