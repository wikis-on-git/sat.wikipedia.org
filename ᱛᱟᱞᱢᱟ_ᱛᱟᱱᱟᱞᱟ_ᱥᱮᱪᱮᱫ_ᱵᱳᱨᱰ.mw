The '''Central Board of Secondary Education''' ('''CBSE''') is a national level board of education in India for public and private schools, controlled and managed by [[Union Government of India]]. CBSE has asked all schools affiliated to follow only NCERT curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/only-ncert-books-at-all-cbse-schools/articleshow/57174456.cms|title=Only NCERT books at all CBSE schools}}</ref> There are approximately 20,299 schools in India and 220 schools in 28 foreign countries affiliated to the CBSE.<ref name=cbse:1/>

==History==
The first education board to be set up in [[India]] was the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Board of High School and Intermediate Education in 1921, which was under jurisdiction of [[Rajputana]], Central India and [[Gwalior]].<ref>{{cite news|title=History (and the Expansion) of the Central Board of Secondary Examination |url=http://www.studypost.com/history-expansion-central-board-secondary-examination|accessdate=16 December 2017|publisher=studypost.com|date=16 December 2017}}</ref> In 1929, the government of India set up a joint Board named "Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana". This included [[Ajmer]], Merwara, Central India and Gwalior. Later it was confined to [[Ajmer]], [[Bhopal]] and [[Vindhya]] Pradesh. In 1952, it became the "Central Board of Secondary Education".

==Affiliations==
CBSE affiliates all [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]s, all [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]]s, private schools and most of the schools approved by [[central government of India]].

==Examinations==
CBSE conducts the final examinations for Class 10 and Class 12 every year in the month of March. The results are announced by the end of May.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBSE Results Announcement Dates: Class 12 on May 25, Class 10 on May 27|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/05/cbse-results-announcement-dates-class-12-on-may-25-class-10-on-may-27/|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|date=23 May 2015}}</ref> The board earlier conducted the [[All India Engineering Entrance Examination|AIEEE]] Examination for admission to undergraduate courses in engineering and architecture in colleges across India. However the AIEEE exam was merged with the IIT-[[Joint Entrance Examination|Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)]] in 2013. The common examination is now called JEE (Main) and is henceforth conducted by [[National Testing Agency]].

CBSE also conducts [[AIPMT]] (All India Pre Medical Test) for admission to major medical colleges in India. In 2014, the conduct of the National Eligibility Test for grant of junior research fellowship and eligibility for assistant professor in institutions of higher learning was outsourced to CBSE.<ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE" />
Apart from these tests, CBSE also conducts the [[Teacher Eligibility Test#Central Teacher Eligibility Test|Central Teacher Eligibility Test]] and the Class X optional proficiency test.<ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE">{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/After-UGCs-failure-CBSE-to-conduct-NET/articleshow/38950641.cms | title=After UGC's failure, CBSE to conduct NET | accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>
With the addition of NET in 2014, the CBSE has become the largest exam conducting body in the world.<ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE" /><ref name="NET to be held under CBSE’s watch">{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/net-to-be-held-under-cbses-watch/article6240205.ece | title=NET to be held under CBSE’s watch | publisher=The Hindu | accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>

On 10 November 2017, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared a proposal for creation of a National Testing Agency (NTA) serving as the premier autonomous body for conducting entrance examinations in the country. Beginning in 2018 various exams previously conducted by the CBSE were transferred to the NTA including [[National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)]], [[Joint Entrance Examination – Main]], [[National Eligibility Test]], [[Central Universities Common Entrance Test]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Testing Agency|url=https://www.nta.ac.in/|access-date=2020-06-07|website=www.nta.ac.in}}</ref>

==Foreign Schools==
According to the official website of CBSE, there are 28 government as well as private affiliated schools in different countries outside India. The reason of their establishment is largely serving the Indian community abroad, or at least, children or relative of Indian diplomats.

For countries where the population of Indian nationals even surpasses the country's native population or in countries where they form a substantial share of the population, like [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], etc., Indian embassies have set up CBSE schools and have allowed Indians or locals to set up private CBSE schools serving the needs of Indians in that particular country.

But, however, in countries where Indians do not reside, the Indian diplomatic missions have set up schools in countries like [[Russia]] and [[Iran]] which mainly serves children of diplomats.
