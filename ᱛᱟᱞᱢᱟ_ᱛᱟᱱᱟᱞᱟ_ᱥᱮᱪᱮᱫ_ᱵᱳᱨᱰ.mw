The '''Central Board of Secondary Education''' ('''CBSE''') is a national level board of education in India for public and private schools, controlled and managed by [[Union Government of India]]. CBSE has asked all schools affiliated to follow only NCERT curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/only-ncert-books-at-all-cbse-schools/articleshow/57174456.cms|title=Only NCERT books at all CBSE schools}}</ref> There are approximately 20,299 schools in India and 220 schools in 28 foreign countries affiliated to the CBSE.<ref name=cbse:1/>

==History==
The first education board to be set up in [[India]] was the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Board of High School and Intermediate Education in 1921, which was under jurisdiction of [[Rajputana]], Central India and [[Gwalior]].<ref>{{cite news|title=History (and the Expansion) of the Central Board of Secondary Examination |url=http://www.studypost.com/history-expansion-central-board-secondary-examination|accessdate=16 December 2017|publisher=studypost.com|date=16 December 2017}}</ref> In 1929, the government of India set up a joint Board named "Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana". This included [[Ajmer]], Merwara, Central India and Gwalior. Later it was confined to [[Ajmer]], [[Bhopal]] and [[Vindhya]] Pradesh. In 1952, it became the "Central Board of Secondary Education".

==Affiliations==
CBSE affiliates all [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]s, all [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]]s, private schools and most of the schools approved by [[central government of India]].

==Examinations==
CBSE conducts the final examinations for Class 10 and Class 12 every year in the month of March. The results are announced by the end of May.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBSE Results Announcement Dates: Class 12 on May 25, Class 10 on May 27|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/05/cbse-results-announcement-dates-class-12-on-may-25-class-10-on-may-27/|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|date=23 May 2015}}</ref> The board earlier conducted the [[All India Engineering Entrance Examination|AIEEE]] Examination for admission to undergraduate courses in engineering and architecture in colleges across India. However the AIEEE exam was merged with the IIT-[[Joint Entrance Examination|Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)]] in 2013. The common examination is now called JEE (Main) and is henceforth conducted by [[National Testing Agency]].

CBSE also conducts [[AIPMT]] (All India Pre Medical Test) for admission to major medical colleges in India. In 2014, the conduct of the National Eligibility Test for grant of junior research fellowship and eligibility for assistant professor in institutions of higher learning was outsourced to CBSE.<ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE" />
Apart from these tests, CBSE also conducts the [[Teacher Eligibility Test#Central Teacher Eligibility Test|Central Teacher Eligibility Test]] and the Class X optional proficiency test.<ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE">{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/After-UGCs-failure-CBSE-to-conduct-NET/articleshow/38950641.cms | title=After UGC's failure, CBSE to conduct NET | accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>

On 10 November 2017, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared a proposal for creation of a National Testing Agency (NTA) serving as the premier autonomous body for conducting entrance examinations in the country. Beginning in 2018 various exams previously conducted by the CBSE were transferred to the NTA including [[National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)]], [[Joint Entrance Examination – Main]], [[National Eligibility Test]], [[Central Universities Common Entrance Test]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Testing Agency|url=https://www.nta.ac.in/|access-date=2020-06-07|website=www.nta.ac.in}}</ref>

In all other cases like absenteeism in an exam for which the student has been registered for, a score is 0 is taken in this case. This means that it is not possible to distinguish from the graph - though it is from the dataset - whether a student actually scored zero or did not show up for the exam itself.</ref>

It is the practice adopted by CBSE of 'tweaking' candidates' marks to account for paper difficulties and variations. This has been criticized in the past for inflating students' marks in a hyper-competitive society where even one mark counts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/cbse-result-2018-the-curious-case-of-magic-mark-95-1744071.html|title=CBSE Result 2018: The Curious Case of 'Magic Mark 95'|publisher=}}</ref> and CBSE is in the process of ending it.{{when|date=February 2019}} In 2017, CBSE informed that it would end moderation entirely, but its decision was challenged by a court case at the Delhi High Court, which ruled that moderation should continue for that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/cbse-moderation-row-board-awarded-up-to-11-grace-marks-in-this-years-class-12th-exams-3508967.html|title=CBSE moderation row: Board awarded up to 11 extra marks in this year's Class 12th exams - Firstpost|website=firstpost.com}}</ref>

With the exception of 2018, moderation was applied to account for variations in region sets (as then students in different regions would be answering different question papers). In 2018, when everyone around the world answered the same questions,<ref>This article shows evidence that CBSE reverted to the past practice in 2019: Chakrabarty, Roshni (7 March 2019).

Retrieved 12 August 2019.</ref> this practice was renamed as ''standardisation,'' with the CBSE gradually phasing out the practice with the reduction on subjects which were given the offset.

In 2018, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Accountancy were given offset of +9, Business Studies given +6, and English given a +3 offset. In 2019, moderation took the effect of giving up to 11 extra marks:<ref name=":1">5; if so, it is ''capped'' at 95 unless the student's actual mark is 96 or more. This is the reason a mark of 95 is relativel</ref>

The total mark obtained by a student through moderation cannot exceed 95; if so, it is ''capped'' at 95 unless the student's actual mark is 96 or more. This is the reason a mark of 95 is relatively common for such subjects, and why it is ''much'' tougher to get 96 than to get a 95.

Moderation was also applied in the infamous CBSE Class 12 mathematics papers of 2015 and 2016, wherein the paper created a huge furore as students and teachers complained that the paper was too tough.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/03/16/cbse-maths-paper_n_9474882.html|title=A CBSE Math Paper So Tough, It Made Students Cry|date=16 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Despite a reportedly heavy offset of +16 (+15 for Delhi),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-with-no-more-marks-moderation-cbse-class-xii-results-du-cutoffs-likely-to-dip-381995|title=With no more ‘marks moderation’, CBSE Class XII results likely to dip; will bring down DU cutoffs|date=18 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref> students' marks reduced (especially for 2016), as while the A1 cutoff was stable (90), the A2 cutoff reduced to 77, with other grades also experiencing a dip in cutoff.

Moderation can also take the form of giving ''grace'' marks to enable students who have scored near the pass mark to pass. This is the reason marks between 25 and 33 are unheard of in subjects like Mathematics, and also explains why the difference between D1 and D2 cutoff is sometimes very small.

== Changes for the 2019 exam ==
=== Earlier duration for vocational exams ===
The CBSE has decided that vocational exams (which very few students take) are to be held earlier - in mid/late February compared to March for most other exams. This is to ensure the exams finish earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/cbse-10th-12th-board-exams-2019-date-sheet-released-check-it-here/story-WBXBxmKzWj2jGOQjQwX7cK.html|title=CBSE 10th, 12th board exams 2019 date sheet released, check it now|date=2018-12-23|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/Notifications/2018/17b_Notification_2018.pdf |title=Info |date=2018 |website=cbseacademic.nic.in |format=PDF}}</ref>

=== More internal options ===
For many core subjects, the number of internal choices (wherein students pick one to answer out of two) has increased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/Notifications/2018/33_Notification_2018.pdf |title=Info |date=2018 |website=cbseacademic.nic.in |format=PDF}}</ref>

=== English paper modifications ===
The English (Core) paper of Class 12 has been modified in a bid to make it less 'speedier'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/Notifications/2018/30_Notification_2018.pdf |title=Notification |date=2018 |website=cbseacademic.nic.in |format=PDF}}</ref>

== Changes for 2020 Exam ==
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will conduct two separate examinations for mathematics in class 10 board examination starting from 2020 session. The current Mathematics exam is now Mathematics Standard, and an easier version of Mathematics has been introduced (called Mathematics Basic). Students taking the latter version may not study Mathematics to any further level.

The option of choosing mathematics will be mentioned in the registration form for class 10 CBSE board examination. Candidates will be required to select their choice of test while filling the registration form for CBSE Class 10 board examination 2020.<ref>https://www.business-standard.com/article/education/cbse-class-10-exam-2020-2-separate-examination-to-be-held-for-mathematics-119081000615_1.html</ref>

[[Minister of Human Resource Development]] (HRD) amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus outbreak]] had ordered rescheduling of pending examinations. The exams rescheduled were to be conducted between 1 and 15 July.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/education/cbse-board-exam-2020-major-update-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19-2197031|title=CBSE Board Exams Postponed Over Coronavirus Outbreak|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-19|title=CBSE Board Class 10, 12 Exam Date Sheet 2020 HIGHLIGHTS: ‘Step is inappropriate’, parents oppose move|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cbse-board-class-10-12-exam-date-sheet-2020-released-live-updates-cbse-nic-in-6415223/|access-date=2020-06-07|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}</ref> On 26 June, CBSE released as circular which cancelled the remaining exams and give scores based on internal exams and scores in other schools. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Bharadwaj|first=Dr Shayam|date=25 June 2020|title=CBSE/CE/SPS/2020|language=english|work=CBSE|publisher=CBSE|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/attach/Notification%20dt.%2025.06.2020.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=26 June 2020}}</ref> This decision came after a judicial ruling.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1970-01-01|title=सीबीएसई 10वीं-12वीं के जुलाई में होने वाले एग्जाम रद्द होंगे, जानिए अब स्टूडेंट्स के पास क्या हैं विकल्प|url=https://hindi.news18.com/news/career/cbse-board-exam-cancel-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak-cbse-10th-and-12th-pending-exam-cancel-know-everything-here-3154324.html|access-date=2020-06-26|website=News18 India}}</ref>

==Regional offices==
Presently CBSE has 10 regional offices:
*[[Delhi]]: Covering NCT of Delhi and Foreign Schools. 
*[[Chennai]]: Covering [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Daman and Diu]], [[Goa]], [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Puducherry]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Telangana]].   
*[[Guwahati]]: Covering [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Manipur]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Mizoram]], [[Nagaland]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Tripura]].  
*[[Ajmer]]: Covering [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]].

*[[Bhubaneswar]]: Covering  [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Odisha]] and  [[West Bengal]].
*[[Thiruvananthapuram]]: Covering [[Kerala]] and [[Lakshadweep]].
*[[Dehradun]]: Covering [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]].

==Foreign Schools==
According to the official website of CBSE, there are 28 government as well as private affiliated schools in different countries outside India. The reason of their establishment is largely serving the Indian community abroad, or at least, children or relative of Indian diplomats.

===Countries where present===

For countries where the population of Indian nationals even surpasses the country's native population or in countries where they form a substantial share of the population, like [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], etc., Indian embassies have set up CBSE schools and have allowed Indians or locals to set up private CBSE schools serving the needs of Indians in that particular country.

But, however, in countries where Indians do not reside, the Indian diplomatic missions have set up schools in countries like [[Russia]] and [[Iran]] which mainly serves children of diplomats.
