The '''Central Board of Secondary Education''' ('''CBSE''') is a national level board of education in India for public and private schools, controlled and managed by [[Union Government of India]]. CBSE has asked all schools affiliated to follow only NCERT curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/only-ncert-books-at-all-cbse-schools/articleshow/57174456.cms|title=Only NCERT books at all CBSE schools}}</ref> There are approximately 20,299 schools in India and 220 schools in 28 foreign countries affiliated to the CBSE.<ref name=cbse:1/>

==History==
The first education board to be set up in [[India]] was the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Board of High School and Intermediate Education in 1921, which was under jurisdiction of [[Rajputana]], Central India and [[Gwalior]].<ref>{{cite news|title=History (and the Expansion) of the Central Board of Secondary Examination |url=http://www.studypost.com/history-expansion-central-board-secondary-examination|accessdate=16 December 2017|publisher=studypost.com|date=16 December 2017}}</ref> In 1929, the government of India set up a joint Board named "Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana". This included [[Ajmer]], Merwara, Central India and Gwalior. Later it was confined to [[Ajmer]], [[Bhopal]] and [[Vindhya]] Pradesh. In 1952, it became the "Central Board of Secondary Education".

==Affiliations==
CBSE affiliates all [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]s, all [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]]s, private schools and most of the schools approved by [[central government of India]].

==Foreign Schools==
According to the official website of CBSE, there are 28 government as well as private affiliated schools in different countries outside India. The reason of their establishment is largely serving the Indian community abroad, or at least, children or relative of Indian diplomats.

For countries where the population of Indian nationals even surpasses the country's native population or in countries where they form a substantial share of the population, like [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], etc., Indian embassies have set up CBSE schools and have allowed Indians or locals to set up private CBSE schools serving the needs of Indians in that particular country.

But, however, in countries where Indians do not reside, the Indian diplomatic missions have set up schools in countries like [[Russia]] and [[Iran]] which mainly serves children of diplomats.
