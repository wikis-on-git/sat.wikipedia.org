The '''Central Board of Secondary Education''' ('''CBSE''') is a national level board of education in India for public and private schools, controlled and managed by [[Union Government of India]]. CBSE has asked all schools affiliated to follow only NCERT curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/only-ncert-books-at-all-cbse-schools/articleshow/57174456.cms|title=Only NCERT books at all CBSE schools}}</ref> There are approximately 20,299 schools in India and 220 schools in 28 foreign countries affiliated to the CBSE.<ref name=cbse:1/>

==History==
The first education board to be set up in [[India]] was the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Board of High School and Intermediate Education in 1921, which was under jurisdiction of [[Rajputana]], Central India and [[Gwalior]].<ref>{{cite news|title=History (and the Expansion) of the Central Board of Secondary Examination |url=http://www.studypost.com/history-expansion-central-board-secondary-examination|accessdate=16 December 2017|publisher=studypost.com|date=16 December 2017}}</ref> In 1929, the government of India set up a joint Board named "Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana". This included [[Ajmer]], Merwara, Central India and Gwalior. Later it was confined to [[Ajmer]], [[Bhopal]] and [[Vindhya]] Pradesh. In 1952, it became the "Central Board of Secondary Education".

==Affiliations==
CBSE affiliates all [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]s, all [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]]s, private schools and most of the schools approved by [[central government of India]].

==Examinations==
CBSE conducts the final examinations for Class 10 and Class 12 every year in the month of March. The results are announced by the end of May.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBSE Results Announcement Dates: Class 12 on May 25, Class 10 on May 27|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2015/05/cbse-results-announcement-dates-class-12-on-may-25-class-10-on-may-27/|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|date=23 May 2015}}</ref> The board earlier conducted the [[All India Engineering Entrance Examination|AIEEE]] Examination for admission to undergraduate courses in engineering and architecture in colleges across India. However the AIEEE exam was merged with the IIT-[[Joint Entrance Examination|Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)]] in 2013. The common examination is now called JEE (Main) and is henceforth conducted by [[National Testing Agency]].

CBSE also conducts [[AIPMT]] (All India Pre Medical Test) for admission to major medical colleges in India. In 2014, the conduct of the National Eligibility Test for grant of junior research fellowship and eligibility for assistant professor in institutions of higher learning was outsourced to CBSE.<ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE" />
Apart from these tests, CBSE also conducts the [[Teacher Eligibility Test#Central Teacher Eligibility Test|Central Teacher Eligibility Test]] and the Class X optional proficiency test.<ref name="Exams conducted by CBSE">{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/After-UGCs-failure-CBSE-to-conduct-NET/articleshow/38950641.cms | title=After UGC's failure, CBSE to conduct NET | accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>

On 10 November 2017, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared a proposal for creation of a National Testing Agency (NTA) serving as the premier autonomous body for conducting entrance examinations in the country. Beginning in 2018 various exams previously conducted by the CBSE were transferred to the NTA including [[National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)]], [[Joint Entrance Examination – Main]], [[National Eligibility Test]], [[Central Universities Common Entrance Test]] and others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Testing Agency|url=https://www.nta.ac.in/|access-date=2020-06-07|website=www.nta.ac.in}}</ref>

== Changes for 2020 Exam ==
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will conduct two separate examinations for mathematics in class 10 board examination starting from 2020 session. The current Mathematics exam is now Mathematics Standard, and an easier version of Mathematics has been introduced (called Mathematics Basic). Students taking the latter version may not study Mathematics to any further level.

The option of choosing mathematics will be mentioned in the registration form for class 10 CBSE board examination. Candidates will be required to select their choice of test while filling the registration form for CBSE Class 10 board examination 2020.<ref>https://www.business-standard.com/article/education/cbse-class-10-exam-2020-2-separate-examination-to-be-held-for-mathematics-119081000615_1.html</ref>

[[Minister of Human Resource Development]] (HRD) amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus outbreak]] had ordered rescheduling of pending examinations. The exams rescheduled were to be conducted between 1 and 15 July.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/education/cbse-board-exam-2020-major-update-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19-2197031|title=CBSE Board Exams Postponed Over Coronavirus Outbreak|website=NDTV.com|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-19|title=CBSE Board Class 10, 12 Exam Date Sheet 2020 HIGHLIGHTS: ‘Step is inappropriate’, parents oppose move|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cbse-board-class-10-12-exam-date-sheet-2020-released-live-updates-cbse-nic-in-6415223/|access-date=2020-06-07|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}</ref> On 26 June, CBSE released as circular which cancelled the remaining exams and give scores based on internal exams and scores in other schools. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Bharadwaj|first=Dr Shayam|date=25 June 2020|title=CBSE/CE/SPS/2020|language=english|work=CBSE|publisher=CBSE|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/attach/Notification%20dt.%2025.06.2020.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=26 June 2020}}</ref> This decision came after a judicial ruling.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1970-01-01|title=सीबीएसई 10वीं-12वीं के जुलाई में होने वाले एग्जाम रद्द होंगे, जानिए अब स्टूडेंट्स के पास क्या हैं विकल्प|url=https://hindi.news18.com/news/career/cbse-board-exam-cancel-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak-cbse-10th-and-12th-pending-exam-cancel-know-everything-here-3154324.html|access-date=2020-06-26|website=News18 India}}</ref>

In March 2018, there were reports that CBSE Class 10 mathematics and Class 12 economics question papers were leaked.<ref name=et63513943>{{cite news|title=CBSE paper leak: Board announces re-exam; HRD initiates probe|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cbse-orders-re-exam-of-class-xii-economics-class-x-mathematics-papers/articleshow/63513943.cms|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=[[The Economic Times]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=28 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330024853/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cbse-orders-re-exam-of-class-xii-economics-class-x-mathematics-papers/articleshow/63513943.cms|archivedate=30 March 2018}}</ref> In response, CBSE announced that these exams will be cancelled and re-exams will be conducted.<ref name=et63513943 /> However, CBSE later announced that there will be no re-exam for Class 10 mathematics paper because the paper leak may have been confined to a few alleged beneficiaries.<ref name="NDTV_1832343">{{cite news|author1=Shihabudeen Kunju S|title=No Re-Exam For Class 10 Maths Paper: CBSE|url=https://www.ndtv.com/education/cbse-class-10-maths-re-exam-internal-inquiries-indicate-few-beneficiaries-no-re-exam-1832343|accessdate=8 April 2018|work=[[NDTV]]|date=3 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404045230/https://www.ndtv.com/education/cbse-class-10-maths-re-exam-internal-inquiries-indicate-few-beneficiaries-no-re-exam-1832343|archivedate=4 April 2018}}</ref>

On 7 April 2018, Rakesh Kumar (an economics teacher) and two other employees of a private school in [[Una, Himachal Pradesh]] were arrested for leaking the Class 12 economics paper.<ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP">{{cite news|last1=Sikdar|first1=Shubhomoy|title=How a Punjab housewife led Delhi cops to source of CBSE Economics paper leak|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/how-a-punjab-housewife-led-delhi-cops-to-source-of-cbse-economics-paper-leak/story-8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP.html|accessdate=8 April 2018|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=8 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408110406/https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/how-a-punjab-housewife-led-delhi-cops-to-source-of-cbse-economics-paper-leak/story-8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP.html|archivedate=8 April 2018|language=en}}</ref> According to the police, Rakesh Kumar had gone inside the strong room of a bank to pick up packets of computer science question papers but also picked up a packet of economics question paper.<ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" /> He asked a student to make a handwritten copy of the question paper (to avoid being traced from the handwriting).<ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" /> He then sent photos of the handwritten copy of the paper on [[WhatsApp]] to a relative in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].<ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" /> This relative shared the photos with her son and nephew, who shared them with their friends on WhatsApp groups, from where it was forwarded to other Whatsapp groups.<ref name="HT_8CSULY1YpP9zSUh0ZUIOaP" />

On 12 April 2018, the police said that Rakesh Kumar, who leaked the class 12 economics paper, had leaked class 10 mathematics paper also.<ref name="bs_118041200431_1">{{cite news|title=Una teacher leaked both CBSE economics and maths question papers: Police|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/una-teacher-leaked-both-cbse-economics-and-maths-question-papers-police-118041200431_1.html|accessdate=12 April 2018|work=[[Business Standard]]|agency=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=12 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412190632/http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/una-teacher-leaked-both-cbse-economics-and-maths-question-papers-police-118041200431_1.html|archivedate=12 April 2018}}</ref>

Consequently, the Central Board of Secondary Education has put in place a system of "encrypted" question papers, which are supposed to be printed by the schools half an hour before the exam starts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cbse.gov.in/contact.htm |title=Contacts |publisher=CBSE |date= |accessdate=2016-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612044924/http://cbse.gov.in/contact.htm |archive-date=12 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

For countries where the population of Indian nationals even surpasses the country's native population or in countries where they form a substantial share of the population, like [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], etc., Indian embassies have set up CBSE schools and have allowed Indians or locals to set up private CBSE schools serving the needs of Indians in that particular country.

But, however, in countries where Indians do not reside, the Indian diplomatic missions have set up schools in countries like [[Russia]] and [[Iran]] which mainly serves children of diplomats.
