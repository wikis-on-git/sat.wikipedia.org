==History==
The first education board to be set up in [[India]] was the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Board of High School and Intermediate Education in 1921, which was under jurisdiction of [[Rajputana]], Central India and [[Gwalior]].<ref>{{cite news|title=History (and the Expansion) of the Central Board of Secondary Examination |url=http://www.studypost.com/history-expansion-central-board-secondary-examination|accessdate=16 December 2017|publisher=studypost.com|date=16 December 2017}}</ref> In 1929, the government of India set up a joint Board named "Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana". This included [[Ajmer]], Merwara, Central India and Gwalior. Later it was confined to [[Ajmer]], [[Bhopal]] and [[Vindhya]] Pradesh. In 1952, it became the "Central Board of Secondary Education".
