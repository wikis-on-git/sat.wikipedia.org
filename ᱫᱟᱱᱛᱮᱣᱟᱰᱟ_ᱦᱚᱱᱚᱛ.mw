The present collector of Dantewada is Shri Saurabh Kumar.<ref>http://dantewada.gov.in</ref>

==History==
Before Indian Independence, the district was part of the [[princely state]] of [[Bastar state|Bastar]]. After Independence in 1947, Bastar's ruler acceded to the government of India, and the erstwhile state became part of Bastar District of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state. Bastar District was divided into the districts of Bastar, Dantewada, and [[Kanker District|Kanker]] in 1998. In 2000, Dantewada was one of the 16 Madhya Pradesh districts that constituted the new state of [[Chhattisgarh]]. Dantewada was bifurcated in 2007, resulting in a new district [[Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh]] with four tehsils: Bijapur, Bhairamgarh, Usoor and Bhopalpatnam. It was further bifurcated in 2012, resulting in another new district, [[Sukma]], with three tehsils: [[Chhindgarh]], Sukma and [[Konta]].
