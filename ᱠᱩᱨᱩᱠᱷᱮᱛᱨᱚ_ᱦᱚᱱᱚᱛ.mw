==Origin of name==
[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kurukshetra war]] depicted in a manuscript of the [[Mahabharata]]]]
The district derived its name from the ancient region of Kurukshetra, which literally means the land of the Kurus. It is believed that the [[Kurukshetra war]] described in the [[Mahabharata Puranas]] and the war was fought here and [[Shree Krishna]] preached the [[Bhagavat Gita]] to [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield before the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==History==
The district was carved out from the erstwhile [[Karnal district]] in 1973. Later some parts of this district were transferred to [[Kaithal district|Kaithal]] and [[Yamuna Nagar district|Yamuna Nagar]] districts at the time of their creation.

==Divisions==
Kurukshetra district comprises two sub-division: Thanesar and Pehowa. Thanesar sub-division comprises two tehsils, Thanesar and Shahabad and two sub-tehsils, [[Ladwa]] and Babain. Pehowa sub-division consists of Pehowa tehsil and Ismailabad sub-tehsil. The significant towns in this district are Kurukushetra, [[Thanesar]] and [[Pehowa]].
