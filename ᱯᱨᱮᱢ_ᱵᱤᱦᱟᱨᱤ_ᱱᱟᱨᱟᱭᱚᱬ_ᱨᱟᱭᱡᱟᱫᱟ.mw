When the Indian Constitution was being drafted by the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] in the late 1940s, Raizada was asked by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to write out the first copy of the seminal document.<ref name=":0" /> Asked what he would charge for hand-writing the constitution, Raizada replied,
<blockquote>
“Not a single penny. By the grace of God I have all the things, and am quite happy with my life,”

“But I have one reservation—that on every page of Constitution I will write my name and on the last page I will write my name along with my grandfather’s name.”<ref name=":1" />
</blockquote>

Prem Behari Narain Raizada was the calligrapher of the Indian Constitution. The original constitution was written by him in a flowing italic style. The Calligraphy of the Hindi version of the Original Constitution was done by Vasant Krishan Vaidya.<ref name=":0" /> Working in a room in Constitution Hall (now known as the [[Constitution Club of India]]), he rendered the document - consisting of 395 articles, 8 schedules, and a preamble - over the course of six months.<ref name=":0" /> He incorporated his flowing style of calligraphy into the document, using hundreds of [[Nib (pen)|pen nibs]] in the course of his writing.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/128712/prem-behari-raizada-india-constitution/|title=Prem Behari Narain Raizada: The Man Who (literally) Wrote India's Constitution|date=2018-01-22|website=The Better India|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/reviving-the-forgotten-art-of-calligraphy-812267|title=Reviving the forgotten art of calligraphy|last=Service|first=Tribune News|website=Tribuneindia News Service|language=en|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> The stipulation that he and his grandfather's names be added to the document was honored, and both names can be seen in the document. When it was completed, the manuscript was 251 pages and weighed 3.75 kg (8.26 lbs).<ref name=":0" /> 

The manuscript was completed on 26 November 1949, and was signed on 26 January 1950.<ref name=":0" />
