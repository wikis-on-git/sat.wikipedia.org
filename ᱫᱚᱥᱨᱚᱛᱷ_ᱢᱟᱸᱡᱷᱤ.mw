[[Block (district subdivision)#India|blocks]] of [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] town from 55&nbsp;km to 15&nbsp;km.{{sfn|Ramnath|2015}}

==ᱯᱩᱭᱞᱩ ᱨᱮᱭᱟᱜ ᱠᱟᱛᱷᱟ==
Dashrath Manjhi was born into a [[Musahar]] family, at the lowest rung of India's caste system.{{sfn|Kumar|2014a}} He ran away from his home at a young age and worked in the coal mines at [[Dhanbad]]. Later he returned to the village of Gehlaur and married Falguni (or Phaguni) Devi.{{sfn|Celestine|1997}}

Gehlaur was and remains a small village with few resources, and while it lies in a plain it is bordered on the south by a steeply ascending quartzite ridge (part of the [[Rajgir hills]]) that prevented road access from the town of Wazirganj.

==ᱚᱜᱷᱚᱴᱚᱱ ᱟᱨ ᱥᱚᱲᱚᱠ ᱵᱮᱱᱟᱣ==
After his return to Gehlaur, Manjhi became an agricultural laborer. In 1959, Manjhi's wife Falguni Devi was badly injured and died because she fell from the mountain and the nearest town with a doctor was {{cvt|55|km|mi|0}} away. Some reports say she was injured while walking along a narrow path across the rocky ridge to bring water or lunch to Manjhi, who had to work away from the village at a location south of the ridge;{{sfn|Celestine|1997}}{{sfn|Viewspaper|2007}}{{sfn|India Post|2016}} other reports link the path across the ridge to the delayed care but not to Falguni Devi's injuries.{{sfn|Gulf News|2015}}

As a result of this experience Manjhi resolved to cut a roadway across the ridge to make his village more accessible.{{sfn|Singh|2012}}{{sfn|ABP News|2014}} Manjhi felt the need to do something for society and decided to carve a path through the ridge so that his village could have easier access to medical care.{{sfn|Celestine|1997}}

He carved a path 110 m long, 7.7 m deep in places and 9.1 m wide to form a road through the ridge of rocks. He said, "When I started hammering the hill, people called me a lunatic but that steeled my resolve."

He completed the work in 22 years (1960–1982). This path reduced the distance between the Atri and Wazirganj sectors of the Gaya district from 55&nbsp;km to 15&nbsp;km. Though mocked for his efforts, Manjhi's work has made life easier for people of the Gehlaur village.{{sfn|ABP News|2014}} Later, Manjhi said, "Though most villagers taunted me at first, there were quite a few who lent me support later by giving me food and helping me buy my tools."{{sfn|Damarla|2012}}

Official roads between his village and Wazirganj and Atri and Gaya were only built where his path was after his death in 2007.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

==ᱜᱩᱨ==
Manjhi was diagnosed with [[gallbladder cancer]] and was admitted to the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] in New Delhi on 23 July 2007. He died at AIIMS on 17 August 2007.{{sfn|Singh|2012}} He was given a state funeral by the [[Government of Bihar]].{{sfn|Gulf News|2015}}

For his feat, Manjhi became popularly known as the 'Mountain Man'. The Bihar government also proposed his name for the [[Padma Shree]] award in 2006 in social service sector.{{sfn|Damarla|2012}}

A stamp featuring Dashrath Manjhi was released by India Post in the "Personalities of Bihar" series on 26 December 2016.{{sfn|India Post|2016}}

==In popular culture==
Dashrath Manjhi's story has been the subject of at least one documentary and several dramatic treatments on film and television.

The first of these was a supporting character based on Manjhi in the 1998 [[Kannada]]-language movie ''[[Bhoomi Thayiya Chochchala Maga]]''.{{sfn|Chitraloka.com|2015}} Manjhi's story also had a minor role in a later Kannada film, 2011's [[Olave Mandara]] directed by [[Jayatheertha]].{{sfn|Bangalore Mirror|2011}}

In 2011, director [[Kumud Ranjan Mullick|Kumud Ranjan]] working for the state-owned [[Films Division of India]] produced a documentary based on Manjhi's life titled ''The Man Who Moved the Mountain''.

In August 2015, a Hindi movie ''[[Manjhi - The Mountain Man]]'' was released and well received. The movie was directed by [[Ketan Mehta]]. [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]] played the role of Manjhi along with [[Radhika Apte]] as Falguni Devi.{{sfn|Bollywood Hungama|2012}}

The first episode of Season 2 of the [[Aamir Khan]] hosted TV Show ''[[Satyamev Jayate (TV series)|Satyamev Jayate]]'', aired in March 2014, was dedicated to Dashrath Manjjhi.{{sfn|Bihar Prabha|2014}}{{sfn|Kumar|2014b}} [[Aamir Khan]] and [[Rajesh Ranjan]] also met Bhagirath Manjhi and Basanti Devi, son and daughter-in-law of Manjhi and promised to provide financial help.{{sfn|NDTV|2014}} However, Basanti Devi died due to inability to afford medical care on 1 April 2014.
