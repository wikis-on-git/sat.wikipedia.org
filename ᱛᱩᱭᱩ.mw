Red fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|42–43}}

Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways.<ref name=rwf1987/> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/>

==Relationships with humans==

===Fur use===
[[File:Fur redfox.jpg|thumb|Red fox pelts]]

Red foxes are among the most important [[Fur#Common furbearers|furbearing]] animals harvested by the [[fur trade]]. Their pelts are used for [[Trim (sewing)|trimming]]s, [[scarf]]s, [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]]s, [[jacket]]s and [[fur coat|coat]]s. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|229–230}} The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as [[cape]]s,<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|246}} while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|252}} The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed by the total number of fox pelts used for trimming purposes.<ref name=bachrach/>{{rp|229–230}} The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|207}}> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|6}} The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50&nbsp;million.<ref name="z134"/> Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.<ref>{{cite web |title=NAFA February 2013 Fur Auction Results |url=http://trappingtoday.com/index.php/category/fur-prices/ |publisher=trappingtoday.com |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

North American red foxes, particularly those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third of the price of their northern Alaskan cousins.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|231}} Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|235}}

===Livestock and pet predation===

Red foxes may on occasion prey on lambs. Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as [[Scottish Blackface|Blackface]], are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as [[Merino]]. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|166–167}}

Red foxes may prey on [[domestic rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|180–181}}

===Urban foxes===
====Distribution====
Red foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs,<ref name="z132"/> although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities. The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering [[Bristol]] and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in [[Cambridge]] and [[Norwich]]. In Ireland they are now common in suburban [[Dublin]]. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in [[Melbourne]] as early as the 1930s, while in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, they only started appearing in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html |title=Urban foxes: Overview |publisher=The fox website |accessdate=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916075909/http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html# |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing. They are rare in areas where industry, [[commerce]] or council-rented houses predominate.<ref name="z132"/> In these latter areas, the distribution is of a lower average density because they rely less on human resources; the home range of these foxes average from {{Convert|80|-|90|ha}}, whereas those in more residential areas average from {{Convert|25|-|40|ha|round=10}}.<ref name="Urban Foxes">{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Stephen|title=Urban Foxes|date=1986|publisher=Whittet Books Ltd.|location=18 Anley Road, London W14 OBY|isbn=978-0905483474}}</ref>

In 2006 it was estimated that there were 10,000 foxes in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/foxes-london.html |title=10,000 Foxes Roam London |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.

====Relationship between urban and rural foxes====
In January 2014 it was reported that "Fleet", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the [[University of Brighton]] in partnership with the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]'', had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in [[Hove]], at the western edge of [[East Sussex]], across rural countryside as far as [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the [[GPS]] collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the United Kingdom, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01qfhsb |title=BBC Two - Winterwatch, Urban Fox Diary: Part 2 |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-25840467 |title=Fleet the Sussex fox breaks British walking record - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref>
