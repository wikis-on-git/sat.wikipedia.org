Red fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|42–43}}
[[File:Red foxes fighting.jpg|thumb|A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (''V. v. macroura'') squabbling]]
Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways.<ref name=rwf1987/> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/>

Red foxes feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures with which they are sympatric. In [[Greek mythology]], the [[Teumessian fox]]<ref>{{Lang-grc|Τευμησ(σ)ία ἀλώπηξ}} (''Teumēs(s)íā alôpēx''),''gen''.: Τευμησίας ἀλώπεκος, also known as ἀλώπηξ τῆς Τευμησσοῦ "fox of [[Teumessos]]"; Teumessos was an ancient city in [[Boeotia]].</ref> or Cadmean vixen, was a gigantic fox that was destined never to be caught.

In [[Celtic mythology]], the red fox is a symbolic animal.

He originally appeared (then under the name of "Reinardus") as a secondary character in the 1150 poem "[[Ysengrimus]]". He reappeared in 1175 in Pierre Saint Cloud's ''Le Roman de Renart'', and made his debut in England in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]''. Many of Reynard's adventures may stem from actual observations on fox behaviour; he is an enemy of the wolf and has a fondness for blackberries and grapes.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|32–33}}

Chinese folk tales tell of fox-spirits called ''[[huli jing]]'' that may have up to nine tails, or ''[[kumiho]]'' as they are known in Korea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goff, Janet |url=https://eee.uci.edu/clients/sbklein/GHOSTS/articles/goff-foxes.pdf |title=Foxes in Japanese culture: Beautiful or beastly? |journal=Japan Quarterly |volume=44 |issue=2 |year=1997 |access-date=28 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053659/https://eee.uci.edu/clients/sbklein/GHOSTS/articles/goff-foxes.pdf |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In [[Japanese mythology]], the [[kitsune]] are fox-like spirits possessing magical abilities that increase with their age and wisdom.

The cunning Fox is commonly found in [[Native American mythology]], where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]]. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote's food. In the [[Achomawi]] [[creation myth]], Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just before the arrival of humans. The [[Yurok tribe]] believed that Fox, in anger, captured the [[sun]], and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An [[Inuit]] story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her.

===Hunting===
{{Further|Fox hunting}}
[[File:Bruno Liljefors - Beagle and Fox.jpg|thumb|upright|''Beagle and Fox'' (1885) by [[Bruno Liljefors]]]]

The earliest historical records of fox hunting come from the fourth century BC; [[Alexander the Great]] is known to have hunted foxes and a [[seal (emblem)|seal]] dated from 350&nbsp;BC depicts a [[Persian people|Persian]] horseman in the process of spearing a fox. [[Xenophon]], who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man's education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were hunting foxes by 80&nbsp;AD. During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. [[Cnut the Great]] reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had a royal [[pack (canine)|pack]] of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Second Duke of York]] assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his ''[[The Master of Game]]''. By the [[Renaissance]], fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the [[English Civil War]] caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the [[Charlton Hunt Club]] in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|21}} Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and [[Maryland]] in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters.<ref name="potts">{{cite book|last1=Potts|first1=Allen|title=Fox Hunting in America|date=1912|publisher=The Carnahan Press|location=Washington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott/page/7 7], 38|url=https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref> These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.<ref name="potts"/>

{{quote|The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement. The grays did not run so far, but usually kept near home, going in a circuit of six or eight
miles. 'An old red, generally so called irrespective of age, as a tribute to his prowess, might lead the dogs all day, and end by losing them as evening fell, after taking them a dead stretch for thirty miles. The capture of a gray was what men boasted of; a chase after 'an old red' was what they 'yarned' about.<ref name="potts"/>}}

Red foxes are still widely persecuted as pests, with human-caused deaths among the highest causes of mortality in the species. Annual fox kills are: UK 21,500–25,000 (2000); Germany 600,000 (2000–2001); Austria 58,000 (2000–2001); Sweden 58,000 (1999–2000); Finland 56,000 (2000–2001); Denmark 50,000 (1976–1977); Switzerland 34,832 (2001); Norway 17,000 (2000–2001); [[Saskatchewan]] (Canada) 2,000 (2000–2001); [[Nova Scotia]] (Canada) 491 (2000–2001); [[Minnesota]] (US) 4,000–8,000 (average annual trapping harvest 2002–2009);<ref name=MNDNRTrapHarvest2008>{{cite book|last1=Dexter|first1=Margaret|title=Trapping Harvest Statistics|date=2009-12-08|publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources|page=282 (Table 5)|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/wildlife/populationstatus2009/7_trapping_harvest.pdf}}</ref> [[New Mexico]] (US) 69 (1999–2000).<ref name="z134"/>

===Fur use===
[[File:Fur redfox.jpg|thumb|Red fox pelts]]

Red foxes are among the most important [[Fur#Common furbearers|furbearing]] animals harvested by the [[fur trade]]. Their pelts are used for [[Trim (sewing)|trimming]]s, [[scarf]]s, [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]]s, [[jacket]]s and [[fur coat|coat]]s. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|229–230}} The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as [[cape]]s,<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|246}} while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|252}} The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed by the total number of fox pelts used for trimming purposes.<ref name=bachrach/>{{rp|229–230}} The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|207}}> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|6}} The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50&nbsp;million.<ref name="z134"/> Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.<ref>{{cite web |title=NAFA February 2013 Fur Auction Results |url=http://trappingtoday.com/index.php/category/fur-prices/ |publisher=trappingtoday.com |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

North American red foxes, particularly those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third of the price of their northern Alaskan cousins.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|231}} Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|235}}

===Livestock and pet predation===
[[File:Picked clean - geograph.org.uk - 500576.jpg|thumb|Carcass of a lamb near a fox den]]
[[File:Urban fox and rabbit.jpg|thumb|Fox in a [[Birmingham]] garden investigates a rabbit hutch]]

Red foxes may on occasion prey on lambs. Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as [[Scottish Blackface|Blackface]], are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as [[Merino]]. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|166–167}}

Red foxes may prey on [[domestic rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|180–181}}

===Taming and domestication===
{{Further|Domesticated red fox}}

In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lucy Jones |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/why-we-love-keeping-foxes-at-home---despite-the-smell/ |title=Why we love keeping foxes at home - despite the smell |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2016-05-07 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref> Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fariha Karim |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-having-mr-fox-to-stay-is-not-such-a-fantastic-idea-after-all-d3wrv7b2c |title=Why having Mr Fox to stay is not such a fantastic idea after all &#124; News &#124; The Times & The Sunday Times |website=Thetimes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref> Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|56}} Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|61}} They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|122}} Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|132–133}}

A strain of truly [[domesticated red fox]]es was introduced by [[Russian people|Russian]] geneticist [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]] who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a [[Domesticated silver fox|population of foxes]] whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included [[piebald]] coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trut, Lyudmila N. |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131052/http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-02-15 |title=Early canid domestication: The farm-fox experiment |journal=American Scientist |volume=87 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=160–169 |doi=10.1511/1999.20.813 }}</ref>

===Urban foxes===
====Distribution====
Red foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs,<ref name="z132"/> although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities. The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering [[Bristol]] and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in [[Cambridge]] and [[Norwich]]. In Ireland they are now common in suburban [[Dublin]]. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in [[Melbourne]] as early as the 1930s, while in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, they only started appearing in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html |title=Urban foxes: Overview |publisher=The fox website |accessdate=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916075909/http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html# |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing. They are rare in areas where industry, [[commerce]] or council-rented houses predominate.<ref name="z132"/> In these latter areas, the distribution is of a lower average density because they rely less on human resources; the home range of these foxes average from {{Convert|80|-|90|ha}}, whereas those in more residential areas average from {{Convert|25|-|40|ha|round=10}}.<ref name="Urban Foxes">{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Stephen|title=Urban Foxes|date=1986|publisher=Whittet Books Ltd.|location=18 Anley Road, London W14 OBY|isbn=978-0905483474}}</ref>

In 2006 it was estimated that there were 10,000 foxes in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/foxes-london.html |title=10,000 Foxes Roam London |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.

====Behaviour====
Urban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1343802/Foxes-getting-bigger--deadly-Marksman-culls-issues-chilling-warning.html|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Bruce|last=Lindsay-Smith|title=Yes, urban foxes are getting bigger ... and more deadly.

====Relationship between urban and rural foxes====
In January 2014 it was reported that "Fleet", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the [[University of Brighton]] in partnership with the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]'', had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in [[Hove]], at the western edge of [[East Sussex]], across rural countryside as far as [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the [[GPS]] collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the United Kingdom, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01qfhsb |title=BBC Two - Winterwatch, Urban Fox Diary: Part 2 |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-25840467 |title=Fleet the Sussex fox breaks British walking record - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref>
