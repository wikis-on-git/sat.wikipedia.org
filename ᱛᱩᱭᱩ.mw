In favourable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number one or two, sometimes up to eight in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly [[dominance (ethology)|dominant]] animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen's kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success. Non-breeding vixens will guard, play, groom, provision and retrieve kits,<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> an example of [[kin selection]]. Red foxes may leave their families once they reach adulthood if the chances of winning a territory of their own are high.

===Reproduction and development===

Red foxes reproduce once a year in spring. Two months prior to [[oestrus]] (typically December), the reproductive organs of vixens change shape and size. By the time they enter their oestrus period, their [[uterine horn]]s double in size, and their [[ovaries]] grow 1.5–2 times larger. [[Spermatogenesis|Sperm formation]] in males begins in August–September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December–February.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> The vixen's oestrus period lasts three weeks,<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> during which the dog-foxes mate with the vixens for several days, often in burrows. {{anchor|Copulation}} The male's [[bulbus glandis]] enlarges during [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]],<ref name="mammals-of-na"/> forming a [[copulatory tie]] which may last for more than an hour.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> The [[gestation period]] lasts 49–58 days.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Though foxes are largely [[monogamous]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iossa | first1 = Graziella |display-authors=etal  | year = 2008 | title = Body mass, territory size, and life-history tactics in a socially monogamous canid, the red fox Vulpes vulpes | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 89 | issue = 6| pages = 1481–1490 | doi=10.1644/07-mamm-a-405.1}}</ref> DNA evidence from one population indicated large levels of [[polygyny]], [[incest]] and mixed paternity litters.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> Subordinate vixens may become pregnant, but usually fail to whelp, or have their kits killed postpartum by either the dominant female or other subordinates.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/>
[[File:Fox_cub_bushes.png|thumb|Red fox cub]]
[[File:Fox kits in front of fox hole.ogg|thumb|Kits coming out of their den]]
The average litter size consists of four to six kits, though litters of up to 13 kits have occurred.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Large litters are typical in areas where fox mortality is high.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|93}} Kits are born blind, deaf and toothless, with dark brown fluffy fur. At birth, they weigh {{convert|56|–|110|g|abbr=on}} and measure {{convert|14.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in body length and {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in tail length. At birth, they are short-legged, large-headed and have broad chests.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Mothers remain with the kits for 2–3 weeks, as they are unable to [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]]. During this period, the fathers or barren vixens feed the mothers.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> Vixens are very protective of their kits, and have been known to even fight off terriers in their defence.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|21–22}} If the mother dies before the kits are independent, the father takes over as their provider.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|13}} The kits' eyes open after 13–15 days, during which time their ear canals open and their upper teeth erupt, with the lower teeth emerging 3–4 days later.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Their eyes are initially blue, but change to amber at 4–5 weeks. Coat colour begins to change at three weeks of age, when the black eye streak appears. By one month, red and white patches are apparent on their faces. During this time, their ears erect and their muzzles elongate.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> Kits begin to leave their dens and experiment with solid food brought by their parents at the age of 3–4 weeks. The [[lactation]] period lasts 6–7 weeks.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Their woolly coats begin to be coated by shiny guard hairs after 8 weeks.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> By the age of 3–4 months, the kits are long-legged, narrow-chested and sinewy. They reach adult proportions at the age of 6–7 months.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Some vixens may reach [[sexual maturity]] at the age of 9–10 months, thus bearing their first litters at one year of age.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> In captivity, their [[longevity]] can be as long as 15 years, though in the wild they typically do not survive past 5 years of age.<ref name="Hunter 2011"/>

===Denning behaviour===
[[File:Foxden.jpg|thumb|Side and above view of a red fox den]]
Outside the [[breeding season]], most red foxes favour living in the open, in densely vegetated areas, though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> Their burrows are often dug on hill or mountain slopes, ravines, bluffs, steep banks of water bodies, ditches, depressions, gutters, in rock clefts and neglected human environments. Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defence mechanism against the spread of disease.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the [[Sexual behavior of wolves|burrows of wolves]], porcupines and other large mammals, as well as those dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40–45°) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from {{convert|0.5|–|2.5|m}}, rarely extending to [[ground water]]. The main passage can reach {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} in length, standing an average of {{convert|5|–|7|m|abbr=on}}. In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> They may share their dens with woodchucks<ref name="mammals-of-na"/> or badgers.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in [[latrine (animal)|latrine]]s, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|15–17}}> The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.<ref name="Holland 2011">{{cite journal |author=Holland, Jennifer S. |title=40 winks? |journal=National Geographic |volume=220 |issue=1 |date=July 2011}}</ref>

==Communication==
===Body language===
[[File:Lis (Vulpes vulpes) WOB.JPG|thumb|left|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an inquisitive posture]]
[[File:Fox study 6.jpg|thumb|right|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an alert posture]]
Red fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|42–43}}
[[File:Red foxes fighting.jpg|thumb|A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (''V. v. macroura'') squabbling]]
Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways.<ref name=rwf1987/> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/>

===Vocalisations===
Red foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five [[octave]]s, which grade into each other.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}} Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> The majority of sounds can be divided into "contact" and "interaction" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}

*'''Contact calls:''' The most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking "''wow wow wow''" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of [[tawny owl]]s). The "''wow wow wow''" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the "''wow wow wow''" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}
*'''Interaction calls:''' When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], called "gekkering". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}

[[File:Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) (W1CDR0001529 BD12).ogg|thumb|left|Fox barks, UK, January 1977]]

Another call that does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic "''waaaaah''" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}

===Diet, hunting and feeding behaviour===
[[File:Red fox with nutria.jpg|thumb|Red fox with [[coypu]]]]
Red foxes are [[omnivore]]s with a highly varied diet. Research conducted in the former Soviet Union showed red foxes consuming over 300 animal species and a few dozen species of plants.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> They primarily feed on small rodents like [[vole]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[ground squirrel]]s, [[hamster]]s, [[gerbil]]s,<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> [[woodchuck]]s, [[pocket gopher]]s and [[deer mouse|deer mice]].<ref name="mammals-of-na"/> Secondary prey species include birds (with [[passeriformes]], [[galliformes]] and [[waterfowl]] predominating), [[leporid]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[reptile]]s, insects, other [[invertebrate]]s and [[flotsam]] ([[marine mammals]], fish and [[echinoderm]]s).<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/><ref name="mammals-of-na"/> On very rare occasions, foxes may attack young or small [[ungulate]]s.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> They typically target mammals up to about {{convert|3.5|kg|abbr=on}} in weight, and they require {{convert|500|g}} of food daily.<ref name="z132"/> Red foxes readily eat plant material, and in some areas fruit can amount to 100% of their diet in autumn. Commonly consumed fruits include [[blueberries]], [[blackberries]], [[raspberries]], [[cherries]], [[persimmon]]s, [[mulberries]], apples, [[plum]]s, [[grapes]], and [[acorn]]s. Other plant material includes [[grass]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] and [[tuber]]s.<ref name="mammals-of-na"/>

Red foxes are implicated in the predation of [[game bird|game]] and [[song bird]]s, hares, [[rabbit]]s, [[muskrat]]s, and young ungulates, particularly in [[Game preservation|preserve]]s, [[Game reserve|reserve]]s, and hunting farms where ground nesting birds are protected and raised, as well as in [[Poultry farming|poultry farm]]s.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/>

===Enemies and competitors===

Red foxes typically dominate other fox species. Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the [[Alexander Archipelago]] during the 1830s–1930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866.<ref name=rwf1987/> Where they are [[sympatry|sympatric]], Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on [[lemming]]s and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> Red foxes are serious competitors of [[corsac fox]]es, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents. Corsac foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi-desert and steppe areas.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=453–454}}</ref> In Israel, Blanford's foxes escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding the open plains inhabited by red foxes.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|84–85}} Red foxes dominate kit and [[swift fox]]es. Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites.<ref name="mammals-of-na"/> [[Grey fox]]es are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas.<ref name="mammals-of-na"/>

The principal cause of this separation is believed to be active avoidance of coyotes by the foxes. Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached. Foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together.<ref name="Sargeant 1989">{{cite journal |author1=Sargeant, Alan B |author2=Allen, Stephen H. |title=Observed interactions between coyotes and red foxes |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |year=1989 |issue=3 |pages=631–633 |url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/mammals/cfoxint/ |laysource=Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center Online |volume=70 |jstor=1381437 |doi=10.2307/1381437 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114195545/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/mammals/cfoxint/ |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In Israel, red foxes share their habitat with [[golden jackal]]s.

Red foxes dominate raccoon dogs, sometimes killing their kits or biting adults to death. Cases are known of foxes killing raccoon dogs entering their dens. Both species compete for mouse-like prey. This competition reaches a peak during early spring, when food is scarce. In [[Tartaria]], red fox predation accounted for 11.1% of deaths among 54 raccoon dogs, and amounted to 14.3% of 186 raccoon dog deaths in north-western Russia.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/>

Red foxes may kill small [[mustelid]]s like [[Least weasel|weasel]]s,<ref name="mammals-of-na"/> [[stone marten]]s,<ref name="z134">{{Harvnb|Sillero-Zubiri|Hoffman|MacDonald|2004|p=134}}</ref> [[pine marten]]s, [[stoat]]s, [[Siberian weasel|kolonok]]s, [[European polecat|polecats]] and young [[sable]]s.

[[Wolverine]]s may kill red foxes, often while the latter are sleeping or near carrion. Foxes in turn may kill unattended young wolverines.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/>

Red foxes may compete with [[striped hyena]]s on large carcasses. Red foxes may give way to hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's stronger jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even when there is no food at stake.

In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by [[leopard]]s, [[caracal]]s and [[Eurasian lynx]]es.

===Diseases and parasites===
[[File:Vulpes vulpes, Red Fox, Zorro.jpg|left|thumb|European red fox with [[mange]]]]
Red foxes are the most important [[rabies]] vector in Europe. In [[London]], [[arthritis]] is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine.<ref name="mammals-of-the-brit-isles"/> Foxes may be infected with [[leptospirosis]] and [[tularemia]], though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from [[listeriosis]] and [[intestinal spirochetosis|spirochetosis]], as well as acting as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] in spreading [[erysipelas]], [[brucellosis]] and tick-borne [[encephalitis]]. A mysterious fatal disease near [[Lake Sartlan]] in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of [[encephalomyelitis]], which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' are known.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/>

Red foxes are not readily prone to infestation with [[flea]]s. Species like ''[[Spilopsyllus cuniculi]]'' are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like ''[[Archaeopsylla erinacei]]'' are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include ''[[Pulex irritans]]'', ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]'' and ''[[Paraceras melis]]''. [[Tick]]s such as ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'' and ''[[Ixodes hexagonus|I.&nbsp;hexagonus]]'' are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The [[louse]] ''[[Trichodectes vulpis]]'' specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The [[mite]] ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'' is the most important cause of [[mange]] in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the [[epizootic]] phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'', ''[[Notoderes]]'', ''[[Otodectes cynotis]]'' (which is frequently found in the [[ear canal]]), ''[[Linguatula serrata]]'' (which infects the nasal passages) and [[ringworm]]s.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/>

Up to 60 [[helminth]] species are known to infect foxes in [[fur farm]]s, while 20 are known in the wild. Several [[coccidia]]n species of the [[genera]] ''[[Isospora]]'' and ''[[Eimeria]]'' are also known to infect them.<ref name="mammals-of-ussr"/> The most common [[nematode]] species found in fox guts are ''[[Toxocara canis]]'' and ''[[Uncinaria stenocephala]]'', ''[[Capillaria aerophila]]''<ref name="Lalošević 2013">{{cite journal |author1=Lalošević, V. |author2=Lalošević, D. |author3=Čapo, I. |author4=Simin, V. |author5=Galfi, A. |author6=Traversa, D. |year=2013 |title=High infection rate of zoonotic ''Eucoleus aerophilus'' infection in foxes from Serbia |journal=Parasite |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=3 |doi=10.1051/parasite/2012003 |pmid=23340229 |pmc=3718516}} {{open access}}</ref> and ''[[Crenosoma vulpis]]'', the latter two infect their lungs. ''[[Capillaria plica]]'' infect the fox's bladder. ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' rarely affects them. The most common [[tapeworm]] species in foxes are ''[[Taenia spiralis]]'' and ''[[Taenia pisiformis|T.&nbsp;pisiformis]]''. Others include ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' and ''[[Echinococcus multilocularis|E.&nbsp;multilocularis]]''.

Red foxes feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures with which they are sympatric.

He originally appeared (then under the name of "Reinardus") as a secondary character in the 1150 poem "[[Ysengrimus]]". He reappeared in 1175 in Pierre Saint Cloud's ''Le Roman de Renart'', and made his debut in England in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]''. Many of Reynard's adventures may stem from actual observations on fox behaviour; he is an enemy of the wolf and has a fondness for blackberries and grapes.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|32–33}}

===Hunting===
{{Further|Fox hunting}}
[[File:Bruno Liljefors - Beagle and Fox.jpg|thumb|upright|''Beagle and Fox'' (1885) by [[Bruno Liljefors]]]]

The earliest historical records of fox hunting come from the fourth century BC; [[Alexander the Great]] is known to have hunted foxes and a [[seal (emblem)|seal]] dated from 350&nbsp;BC depicts a [[Persian people|Persian]] horseman in the process of spearing a fox. [[Xenophon]], who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man's education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were hunting foxes by 80&nbsp;AD. During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. [[Cnut the Great]] reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had a royal [[pack (canine)|pack]] of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Second Duke of York]] assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his ''[[The Master of Game]]''. By the [[Renaissance]], fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the [[English Civil War]] caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the [[Charlton Hunt Club]] in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|21}} Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and [[Maryland]] in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters.<ref name="potts">{{cite book|last1=Potts|first1=Allen|title=Fox Hunting in America|date=1912|publisher=The Carnahan Press|location=Washington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott/page/7 7], 38|url=https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref> These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.<ref name="potts"/>

{{quote|The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement. The grays did not run so far, but usually kept near home, going in a circuit of six or eight
miles. 'An old red, generally so called irrespective of age, as a tribute to his prowess, might lead the dogs all day, and end by losing them as evening fell, after taking them a dead stretch for thirty miles. The capture of a gray was what men boasted of; a chase after 'an old red' was what they 'yarned' about.<ref name="potts"/>}}

Red foxes are still widely persecuted as pests, with human-caused deaths among the highest causes of mortality in the species. Annual fox kills are: UK 21,500–25,000 (2000); Germany 600,000 (2000–2001); Austria 58,000 (2000–2001); Sweden 58,000 (1999–2000); Finland 56,000 (2000–2001); Denmark 50,000 (1976–1977); Switzerland 34,832 (2001); Norway 17,000 (2000–2001); [[Saskatchewan]] (Canada) 2,000 (2000–2001); [[Nova Scotia]] (Canada) 491 (2000–2001); [[Minnesota]] (US) 4,000–8,000 (average annual trapping harvest 2002–2009);<ref name=MNDNRTrapHarvest2008>{{cite book|last1=Dexter|first1=Margaret|title=Trapping Harvest Statistics|date=2009-12-08|publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources|page=282 (Table 5)|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/wildlife/populationstatus2009/7_trapping_harvest.pdf}}</ref> [[New Mexico]] (US) 69 (1999–2000).<ref name="z134"/>

===Fur use===
[[File:Fur redfox.jpg|thumb|Red fox pelts]]

Red foxes are among the most important [[Fur#Common furbearers|furbearing]] animals harvested by the [[fur trade]]. Their pelts are used for [[Trim (sewing)|trimming]]s, [[scarf]]s, [[muff (handwarmer)|muff]]s, [[jacket]]s and [[fur coat|coat]]s. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|229–230}} The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as [[cape]]s,<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|246}} while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|252}} The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed by the total number of fox pelts used for trimming purposes.<ref name=bachrach/>{{rp|229–230}} The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|207}}> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|6}} The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50&nbsp;million.<ref name="z134"/> Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.<ref>{{cite web |title=NAFA February 2013 Fur Auction Results |url=http://trappingtoday.com/index.php/category/fur-prices/ |publisher=trappingtoday.com |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

North American red foxes, particularly those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third of the price of their northern Alaskan cousins.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|231}} Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.<ref name="bachrach"/>{{rp|235}}

===Livestock and pet predation===
[[File:Picked clean - geograph.org.uk - 500576.jpg|thumb|Carcass of a lamb near a fox den]]
[[File:Urban fox and rabbit.jpg|thumb|Fox in a [[Birmingham]] garden investigates a rabbit hutch]]

Red foxes may on occasion prey on lambs. Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as [[Scottish Blackface|Blackface]], are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as [[Merino]]. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|166–167}}

Red foxes may prey on [[domestic rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|180–181}}

===Taming and domestication===
{{Further|Domesticated red fox}}

In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lucy Jones |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/why-we-love-keeping-foxes-at-home---despite-the-smell/ |title=Why we love keeping foxes at home - despite the smell |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2016-05-07 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref> Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fariha Karim |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-having-mr-fox-to-stay-is-not-such-a-fantastic-idea-after-all-d3wrv7b2c |title=Why having Mr Fox to stay is not such a fantastic idea after all &#124; News &#124; The Times & The Sunday Times |website=Thetimes.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref> Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|56}} Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|61}} They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|122}} Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.<ref name="dale"/>{{rp|132–133}}

A strain of truly [[domesticated red fox]]es was introduced by [[Russian people|Russian]] geneticist [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]] who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a [[Domesticated silver fox|population of foxes]] whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included [[piebald]] coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trut, Lyudmila N. |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131052/http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-02-15 |title=Early canid domestication: The farm-fox experiment |journal=American Scientist |volume=87 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=160–169 |doi=10.1511/1999.20.813 }}</ref>

===Urban foxes===
====Distribution====
Red foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs,<ref name="z132"/> although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities. The species first colonised British cities during the 1930s, entering [[Bristol]] and London during the 1940s, and later established themselves in [[Cambridge]] and [[Norwich]]. In Ireland they are now common in suburban [[Dublin]]. In Australia, red foxes were recorded in [[Melbourne]] as early as the 1930s, while in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, they only started appearing in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html |title=Urban foxes: Overview |publisher=The fox website |accessdate=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916075909/http://www.thefoxwebsite.org/urbanfoxes/index.html# |archive-date=16 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Urban red foxes are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing. They are rare in areas where industry, [[commerce]] or council-rented houses predominate.<ref name="z132"/> In these latter areas, the distribution is of a lower average density because they rely less on human resources; the home range of these foxes average from {{Convert|80|-|90|ha}}, whereas those in more residential areas average from {{Convert|25|-|40|ha|round=10}}.<ref name="Urban Foxes">{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Stephen|title=Urban Foxes|date=1986|publisher=Whittet Books Ltd.|location=18 Anley Road, London W14 OBY|isbn=978-0905483474}}</ref>

In 2006 it was estimated that there were 10,000 foxes in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/foxes-london.html |title=10,000 Foxes Roam London |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> City-dwelling foxes may have the potential to consistently grow larger than their rural counterparts, as a result of abundant scraps and a relative dearth of predators. In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.

====Behaviour====
Urban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1343802/Foxes-getting-bigger--deadly-Marksman-culls-issues-chilling-warning.html|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Bruce|last=Lindsay-Smith|title=Yes, urban foxes are getting bigger ... and more deadly. As a 4&nbsp;ft fox is shot in Kent, a marksman who culls them for a living issues a chilling warning|date=20 September 2013}}</ref> Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.<ref name="Urban Foxes"/>

====Urban fox control====
Urban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing.<ref name="Urban Foxes"/> In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method.<ref name=Fieldsportschannel>{{cite web|title=Fieldsports Britain : How to call in great big bucks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3doTc9A31Y|publisher=Fieldsportschannel.tv|date=24 October 2012}}</ref> However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.<ref name="Urban Foxes"/>

====Relationship between urban and rural foxes====
In January 2014 it was reported that "Fleet", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the [[University of Brighton]] in partnership with the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]'', had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in [[Hove]], at the western edge of [[East Sussex]], across rural countryside as far as [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the [[GPS]] collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage. Along with setting a record for the longest journey undertaken by a tracked fox in the United Kingdom, his travels have highlighted the fluidity of movement between rural and urban fox populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01qfhsb |title=BBC Two - Winterwatch, Urban Fox Diary: Part 2 |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-25840467 |title=Fleet the Sussex fox breaks British walking record - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref>
