The '''Bengal fox''' (''Vulpes bengalensis''), also known as the '''Indian fox''', is a [[fox]] [[endemic]] to the [[Indian subcontinent]] and is found from the [[Himalaya]]n foothills and Terai of [[Nepal]] through southern [[India]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vanak, A.T. |year=2005|title= Distribution and status of the Indian fox ''Vulpes bengalensis'' in southern India|journal=Canid News |volume=8|issue=1|url=http://www.canids.org/canidnews/8/Indian_fox_in_southern_India.pdf}}</ref> and from southern and eastern [[Pakistan]] to eastern [[India]] and southeastern [[Bangladesh]].<ref name=mamspec>{{cite journal|author1=Gompper, ME  |author2=A.T.

==Appearance==
[[File:VulpesBengalensisFBI.jpg|thumb|left|Skull]]
''Vulpes bengalensis'' is a relatively small fox with an elongated muzzle, long, pointed ears, and a bushy tail about 50 to 60% of the length of the head and body. Its dorsal [[pelage]] is very variable, but mostly grayish and paler ventrally; its legs tend to be brownish or [[rufous]]. It is more daintily built than ''[[Vulpes vulpes]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Menon |first=Vivek |title=Mammals of India |series=Princeton Field Guides |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-14067-4}}</ref> The tail is bushy with a prominent black tip which distinguishes it from ''V. vulpes''. Back of ears are dark brown with black margin. Its [[rhinarium]] is naked and the lips are black, with small black hair patches on upper part of nuzzle (shaft) in front of eyes. The ears have the same colour as the nape or maybe darker, but not having a dark patch as in ''V. vulpes''. Extensive variation in coat colour exists across populations and seasonally within populations, but generally varies from grey to pale brown. The head and body length is {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} long tail. Typical weight is {{convert|5|to|9|lb|kg}}.<ref name=mamspec/>

The genus ''Vulpes'' can be separated from ''Canis'' and ''Cuon'' in the Indian region by the flat forehead between the postorbital processes and not inflated by air cells. The processes themselves are slightly concave with a raised anterior edge (convexly round in other canids). The canine teeth are longer.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pocock RI |year=1937|title= The foxes of British India |journal=J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. |volume=39|issue=1|pages=36–57}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Indian Fox at Little Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|Female Bengal fox at den site in the [[Little Rann of Kutch]]]]
[[File:Indian Fox in a Grassland.jpg|thumb|Male Bengal fox]]
The Bengal fox is distributed throughout much of the Indian subcontinent with the exception of the wet forests and the extreme arid zone. Its range is bounded by the [[Himalaya]]s and the [[Indus River]] valley. Its preferred habitat is short open grassland, scrub or thorn forest. It appears to avoid steep terrain and tall grassland.<ref name=mamspec/> It was considered to be a habitat [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]], but it shows a strong preference for semiarid, short grassland habitats at multiple scales.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Vanak, A.T.  |author2=Gompper, M. E. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010| title=Multiscale resource selection and spatial ecology of the Indian fox in a human-dominated dry grassland ecosystem| journal= Journal of Zoology|volume=281|issue=2|pages=140–148|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2010.00690.x}}</ref>

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Vulpes bengalensis fur skin.jpg|thumb|Bengal fox pelt]]
Bengal foxes are mainly [[crepuscular]] in their habits. During the heat of the day, they hide under vegetation or in subterranean dens that they dig. The dens are large and complex with multiple chambers and escape routes. They are sometimes seen basking at a vantage point around sunrise or sunset.<ref name=ajtj/> In captivity, the lifespan is about 6 to 8 years.<ref name=mamspec/>

=== Diet ===
The Bengal fox feeds on [[rodent]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[crab]]s, [[termite]]s, insects, small [[bird]]s, and fruits.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Vanak AT, Gompper ME|lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009|title= Dietary niche separation between sympatric free-ranging dogs and Indian foxes in central India|journal= J.

===Communication===
Foxes make a wide range of vocalizations. A chattering cry is the most common call. They also growl, whine, whimper, and bark. The Bengal fox does not appear to have [[latrine behaviour]], a feature seen in some social canids, in which all members defecate at specific spots.<ref name=ajtj/> They can be heard howling in the night in groups.

===Reproduction===
The Bengal fox forms pair bonds that may last a lifetime, but extra-pair copulations are known to occur. Throughout most of its range, the mating season starts in autumn (usually October–November) and after a [[gestation period]] around 50–60 days, two to four pups are born in a den. Both parents participate in pup-rearing. The pups are fully weaned about 3–4 months after emerging from the den. Pup mortality is high during the first few months.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Vanak, A.T.  |author2=Gompper, M.E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title= Effectiveness of non-invasive techniques for surveying activity and habitat use of the Bengal fox ''Vulpes bengalensis'' in southern India|journal=Wildlife Biology |volume=13|pages=219–224|doi=10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[219:eontfs]2.0.co;2}}</ref> Pups may sometimes be nursed by multiple females.<ref name=ajtj/> During the day, they tend to rest under shrubs and bushes, except in summer when they rest in dens.
