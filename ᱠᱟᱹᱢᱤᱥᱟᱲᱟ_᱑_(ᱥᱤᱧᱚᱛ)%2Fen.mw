== Report ==
[[File:Fagu Baskey.webm|thumb|300px|[[:incubator:User:Fagu Baskey|Fagu Baskey]], the most active editor of Santali Wikipedia during the time of recording shares his experience from the first ever Santali Wikipedia workshop in India at the North Odisha Universiry, Baripada, Mayurbhanj, Odisha. In this interview with another Santali editor [[:incubator:User:R Ashwani Banjan Murmu|Ashwani Banjan Murmu]], he shares his plans for growing the Santali Wikipedia community by organizing more outreach sessions, and collaborating with editors dispersed across eastern India.]]
Some of the contributors of the Santali Wikipedia, which is currently in the Incubator, reached out to us seeking help in organizing a workshop. Three editors including two administrators worked with three active Santali Wikipedians from Odisha, and organized a [[:incubator:Wp/sat/ᱠᱟᱹᱢᱤᱥᱟᱲᱟ ᱑ (ᱥᱤᱧᱚᱛ)/en|workshop]] at the North Odisha University, Baripada, Mayurbhanj, Odisha. With support from [[Talk:CIS-A2K/Requests#Request_for_a_training_workshop_for_Santali_editors|CIS-A2K]] this workshop brought together nearly 30 new contributors. Though it was challenging—to teach all the new editors about the [[:mediawiki:Help:Extension:UniversalLanguageSelector/Input methods/sat-Sarjom baha|input tools]], and basics of Wikipedia—all in one session, there was quite some productive engagement. The community that is currently spread across India, Bangladesh and Nepal are sharing resources with each other, to reach out to more people, and bring the project out of Incubator. Odia Wikimedians User Group was fortunate to contribute a little part in enabling this.
