For his contributions to film, the [[Government of India]] honoured him with the [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]] in 2001, and the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2005.<ref name="Padma Awards">{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref> [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] presented him with a lifetime membership, making him the first Indian to receive the honour.

Chopra began his career as an assistant director to [[I. S. Johar]] and his elder brother, [[B.R. Chopra]]. He made directorial debut with ''[[Dhool Ka Phool]]'' in 1959, a melodrama about illegitimacy, and followed it with the social drama ''[[Dharmputra]]'' (1961). Chopra rose to prominence after directing the critically and commercially successful drama ''[[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]]'' (1965), which pioneered the concept of ensemble casts in Bollywood. In 1971, he founded his own production company, Yash Raj Films, whose first production was ''[[Daag (1973 film)|Daag: A Poem of Love]]'' (1973), a successful melodrama about polygamy. His success continued in the seventies, with some of Indian cinema's most successful and iconic films, including the action thriller ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), which established [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as a leading actor in Bollywood; the ensemble romantic drama ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhie Kabhie]]'' (1976) and the ensemble drama ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978). This was followed by a period of professional setback from the late 1970s to 1989.

Chopra collaborated with [[Sridevi]] in two of what has been considered to be his finest films; the romantic  musical ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989), which became instrumental in ending the era of violent films in Bollywood and returning to musicals, and the intergenerational romantic drama ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991), considered by critics and Chopra himself to be his best work, but underperformed at the domestic box office although brought profits overseas.
