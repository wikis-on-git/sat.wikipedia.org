==Early life, family and education==
Ramdev was born in a Hindu family in 1965 to Ram Niwas Yadav and Gulabo Devi at Saiyad Pur village of [[Mahendragarh district]], Haryana; Both of his parents were farmers.<ref>{{citation |url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/NAT-IDP-who-is-baba-ramdev-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-yoga-guru-2158058.html |title=Baba Ramdev |work=[[Daily Bhaskar]] |date=3 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The rise and rise of Baba Ramdev|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/video/the-rise-and-rise-of-baba-ramdev/1/141217.html|website=India Today|publisher=Living Media India Limited|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref> He claims he was paralyzed when he was two and a half years old, and was later cured by practising yoga. He studied Indian [[scripture]], [[Yoga]] and [[Sanskrit]] in various [[Gurukul]]s schools. He was the student of Acharya Baldevji in Gurukul Kalwa and learnt yoga from Guru Karamvir, an [[Arya Samaji]].<ref name="wire" /> He took ''[[sanyasi]]'' [[diksha]] and adopted the name Swami Ramdev from Swami Shankar Dev Ji.<ref name="ndtv">{{cite web |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/who-is-baba-ramdev-109946 |date=15 November 2011 |title=Who is Baba Ramdev? |publisher=NDTV |access-date=9 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419113020/http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/who-is-baba-ramdev-109946 |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While living in Kalwa Gurukul in [[Jind district]], Haryana, Ramdev offered free yoga training to villagers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deshvidesh.com/issues/desh1509/Swami_Ramdev_Baba.html |title=Baba Ramdev Offered Free Yoga Training in Kalva gurukul |website=deshvidesh.com |date=1 September 2006}}</ref> Then he moved to [[Haridwar]] in Uttarakhand, where he practised self-discipline and meditation, and spent several years studying ancient Indian scriptures at [[Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya]].

Towards the end of the 1990s, farming conditions in his native village worsened, due to the region's depleting water table, which prompted Ramdev's move to Haridwar. Subsequently, he called his family to Haridwar. Ramdev's family members have played different roles in his ayurveda ventures depending on their capabilities. His father oversees activities in Patanjali ayurved, his brother Rambharat controls the company's finances.<ref name="wire">{{cite news |last1=Ahmad |first1=Omair |title=Interview: The Many, Many Things We Don't Know About Baba Ramdev |url=https://thewire.in/books/interview-baba-ramdev-patanjali |accessdate=8 November 2018 |work=The Wire |date=3 October 2018}}</ref>
