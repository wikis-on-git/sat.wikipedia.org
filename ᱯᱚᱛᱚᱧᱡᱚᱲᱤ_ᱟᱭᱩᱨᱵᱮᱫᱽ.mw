==Controversies==
===Suspension of Amla juice===
The Ministry of Defence's canteen stores department (CSD) had suspended the sale of Patanjali Ayurved's amla juice after receiving an adverse state-laboratory test report on the product.

The move came after the product was tested at the central food lab that found it to be 'unfit for consumption'. After which, the CSD asked all its depots to make debit notes for their existing stock so that the product can be returned.<ref>https://hindustantimes.com/india-news/baba-ramdev-s-patanjali-products-fail-uttarakhand-quality-test/story-bXo4XySEajw7ZDby4GISML.html</ref>
