He subsequently appeared ''[[Bardaasht]]'' and ''[[Naach (2004 film)|Naach]]'', both of them being box-office duds.<ref name="riteish movies rediff"/> His first relatively successful lead role occurred in the widely panned sex-comedy ''[[Kyaa Kool Hai Hum]]'' with [[Tusshar Kapoor]]. While the film was reviled by critics, it was appreciated by audiences and declared a moderate success at the box office. Ritesh, by now had earned a strong foothold in the Bollywood film industry via his comic roles

In 2012, he first appeared in ''[[Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya]]'' in which he is paired opposite his real wife [[Genelia D'Souza]]. It proved a commercial hit despite being a shoestring budget. He then starred in a sequel, ''[[Housefull 2]]'', which released on 6 April 2012 and was a huge success like its predecessor. ''Housefull 2'' has been marked as Ritesh's biggest success to date. His last release of the year and his latest film was sequel ''[[Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum]]'', which released on 27 July 2012.

Deshmukh then starred in another sequel, this time to the 2004 hit ''[[Masti (2004 film)|Masti]]'' titled ''[[Grand Masti]]'' which released in September 2013 and became a box office success, despite receiving negative reviews. Deshmukh made his debut as a film producer with the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] film ''[[Balak Palak]]'', directed by [[Ravi Jadhav]]. It released on 4 January 2013 and was a success. Deshmukh has decided to make a Hindi remake of the film.

In 2014, Deshmukh appeared in 2 completely different roles; first in the romance-comedy film ''[[Humshakals]]'', which was a box office failure and then in the romance-thriller ''[[Ek Villain]]''. With ''Ek Villain'', Riteish made his debut as an antagonist (villain), acting a part like this for the first time. Ek Villain was a box office success. Besides this, he also made his acting debut in [[Marathi cinema]] the same year with the action film ''Lai Bhaari''.

In 2015, he appeared in ''[[Bangistan]]'' along with [[Pulkit Samrat]]. The film was a comedy-satire and received a mixed critical response. However, was a box office disaster.

In 2016, he appeared in the third installment of the Housefull and Masti series ''[[Housefull 3]]'' and ''[[Great Grand Masti]]'' and a musical drama ''[[Banjo]]''. He appeared in the comedy film ''[[Bank Chor]]'' which was released in 2017 and is scheduled to appear in action film ''[[Mauli (film)|Mauli]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ganesan|first=Ranjita|title=Has Riteish Deshmukh finally come of age?|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/has-riteish-deshmukh-finally-come-of-age-114071801275_1.html|accessdate=19 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722082828/http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/has-riteish-deshmukh-finally-come-of-age-114071801275_1.html|archive-date=22 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
