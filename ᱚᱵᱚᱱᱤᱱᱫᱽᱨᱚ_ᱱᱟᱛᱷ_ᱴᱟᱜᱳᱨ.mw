'''ᱚᱵᱚᱱᱤᱱᱫᱽᱨᱚ ᱱᱟᱛᱷ ᱴᱟᱜᱳᱨ''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CIE}} (অবনীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর)  (7 August 1871&nbsp;– 5 December 1951) was the principal artist and creator of the "Indian Society of Oriental Art". He was also the first major exponent of [[Swadeshi]] values in [[Indian art]], thereby founding the influential [[Bengal school of art]], which led to the development of [[modern Indian painting]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Atlas of World Art|author=John Onians |authorlink=John Onians  |chapter=Bengal School|publisher=Laurence King Publishing |year=2004|isbn= 1856693775|page=304 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&pg=PA304&dq=Bengal+School+of+Art&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5uW0T8OdCZCJrAfJ4OWSDA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Bengal%20School%20of%20Art&f=false |ref=On }}</ref><ref name = "Abanidra">[http://www.chitralekha.org/abanindranath.htm Abanindranath Tagore, A Survey of the Master’s Life and Work by Mukul Dey], reprinted from "Abanindra Number," ''The Visva-Bharati Quarterly,'' May&nbsp;– Oct. 1942.</ref> He was also a noted writer, particularly for children. Popularly known as 'Aban Thakur', his books ''Rajkahini, Budo Angla, Nalak,'' and ''[[Khirer Putul]]'' were landmarks in [[Bengali language]] children's literature and art.

Tagore sought to modernise [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Rajput]] styles to counter the influence of [[Western culture|Western]] models of art, as taught in art schools under the [[British Raj]]. Along with other artists from the Bengal school of art, Tagore advocated in favour of a nationalistic Indian art derived from Indian art history, drawing inspiration from the [[Ajanta Caves]]. Tagore's work was so successful that it was eventually accepted and promoted as a national Indian style within British art institutions.

Abanindranath Tagore was born in [[Jorasanko]], [[Calcutta]], [[British Raj|British India]], to Gunendranath Tagore and Saudamini Tagore. His grandfather was Girindranath Tagore, the second son of "Prince" Dwarkanath Tagore. He was a member of the distinguished [[Tagore family]], and a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. His grandfather and his elder brother, [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], were also artists.

Tagore learned art when studying at [[Sanskrit College]], Kolkata in the 1880s. 

In 1890, around the age of twenty years, Abanindranath attended the [[Calcutta School of Art]] where he learnt to use pastels from O. Ghilardi, and oil painting from C. Palmer, European painters who taught in that institution.<ref name="Chaitanya1994">{{cite book|last=Chaitanya|first=Krishna|title=A history of Indian painting: the modern period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McSbSMhArFgC|accessdate=12 December 2011|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-310-6|page=145}}</ref>

In 1889, he married Suhasini Devi, daughter of Bhujagendra Bhusan Chatterjee, a descendant of [[Prasanna Coomar Tagore]]. At this time he left the Sanskrit College after nine years of study and studied English as a special student at [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. Xavier's College]], which he attended for about a year and a half.

He had a sister, [[Sunayani Devi]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=40949 |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129204733/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=40949 |archive-date=29 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
