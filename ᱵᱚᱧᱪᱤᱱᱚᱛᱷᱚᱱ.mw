The railway station has since been renamed Vanchi Maniyachi.

== Assassination of Ashe==
The mastermind behind the assassination was Nilakanta Brahmachari who went around the Madras presidency in 1910 recruiting cadres and hatching plots against the British. In this venture, he was accompanied by Shankar Krishna Iyer, Vanchinathan's brother-in-law, who introduced the men to each other. Along with a few other men, Nilakanta Bramhachari, Vaanchinathan, and Shankar Krishna Aiyar found an organisation called Bharatha Matha Sangam which plots the assassination of influential British men.   
On 17 June 1911, Ashe boarded the 9:30 am Maniyachi Mail at Tirunelveli Junction. With him was his wife, Mary Lillian Patterson, who had arrived from Ireland only a few days earlier. They had married on 6 April 1898, in Berhampore; Mary was about a year older than Ashe. They were on their way to Kodaikanal where their four children, Molly, Arthur, Sheila, and Herbert, lived in a rented bungalow.
At 10:38 am, the train pulled in at Maniyachi. The Ceylon Boat Mail was due to arrive at 10:48 am. As the Ashes sat facing each other in the first class carriage, waiting for the Boat Mail to arrive, a neatly dressed man with tufted hair and another young man wearing a dhoti approached the carriage. The former boarded the carriage and pulled out a Belgian-made Browning automatic pistol. The bullet hit Ashe in the chest and he collapsed. The sound of the pistol shot was absorbed by the howling wind. <ref>[https://www.thesundayindian.com/en/story/late-british-officer's-kin-sent-letter-to-killer's-kin/5/16690/]</ref>.
<ref>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Freedom-fighter-Vanchinathan-remembered/articleshow/47708113.cms]</ref>

After the shooting, Vanchinathan ran along the platform and took cover in the latrine. Sometime later he was found dead, having shot himself in the mouth. The pistol recovered from him was empty without any bullets as he just planned to kill himself after killing Ashe and had no intention to hurt anyone other than Ashe<ref>{{cite news|title=Centenary of a historical assassination today |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article2110600.ece|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=17 June 2011|location=India}}</ref> In his pocket was found  following letter:

{{Quote frame| I dedicate my life as a small contribution to my motherland. I am alone responsible for this. 

The [[Mleccha|mlechas]] of England having captured our country, tread over the sanathana dharma of the Hindus and destroy them. Every Indian is trying to drive out the English and get swarajyam and restore sanathana dharma. Our Raman, Sivaji, Krishnan, Guru Govindan, Arjuna ruled our land protecting all dharmas, but in this land, they are making arrangements to crown George V, a [[Mleccha|mlecha]], and one who eats the flesh of cows. 

Three thousand Madrasees have taken a vow to kill George V as soon as he lands in our country. In order to make others know our intention, I who am the least in the company, have done this deed this day. This is what everyone in Hindustan should consider it as his duty. 

I will kill Ashe, whose arrival here is to celebrate the crowning of cow-eater King George V in this glorious land which was once ruled by great samrats. This I do to make them understand the fate of those who cherish the thought of enslaving this sacred land. 

I, as the least of them, wish to warn George by killing Ashe.

Vanchi was a close collaborator of [[Varahaneri Venkatesa Subrahmanya Iyer]] (normally shortened to [[V.V.S.Aiyar]] or Va.Ve.Su Iyer), another activist who sought arms to defeat the British.

[[The Hindu (Tamil)]] published an article based, what it said, on an interview with Jayakrishnan, who claimed to be the grandson of Vanchinathan. It was said in the article that Jayakrishnan blamed (his grandfather) Vanchinathan for neglecting his wife who was 8 months pregnant at that time. Jayakrishnan has purportedly said "What he (Vanchinathan) did was wrong".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tamil.thehindu.com/opinion/reporter-page/article19496176.ece | title="Andraikku Thaathaa Seydhathu Thappu Thaane ..!" - Pattikkaaga Varundum Veeran Vanchinathanin Paeran | trans-title="Isn't what grandpa did then wrong..!" - Vanchinathan's grandson sympathizes for grandma | language=Tamil | work=[[The Hindu (Tamil)]] | date=2017-08-15 | accessdate=2017-08-20 | author=Kula.

For the first time in the history of independent India, a Dalit group paid floral tributes to Ashe. “Since this great Briton was against untouchability and recognised the Dalits as human beings even when the caste-ridden society took all-out measures to oppress them, we pay floral tributes to the slain Collector,” justified members of Aathi Thamizhar Katchi. <ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dalit-outfit-pays-homage-to-ashe/article7327748.ece</ref>
