'''Prataparudra Deva''' ([[Odia language|Odia]]: '''ଗଜପତି ପ୍ରତାପରୁଦ୍ର ଦେବ''') was the last Gajapati emperor of Odisha from the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Suryavamshi]] dynasty started by his grandfather [[Kapilendradeva|Kapilendra Deva Routaraya]]. He ruled from the year 1497 to 1540 A.D. Besides being a ruler, he was a devout [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] and adherent of the famous saint, Sri [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanaya]] who arrived in [[Odisha]] during is rule. His life was extremely occupied with overwhelming military campaigns in defense of his inherited territory from three frontal invasions by the enemy states [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]], [[Hussain Shahi dynasty|Hussain Shahi]] dynasty of [[Bengal]] and [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Qutb Shahi]] dynasty of [[Golkonda|Golconda]]. He lost large portions of his territory to the neighboring enemy states initiating the dissolution of Odisha's military hegemony and imperial status that continued for nearly a period of 600 years before him.

== Personality and Historical Consequences ==
The rule of Prataparudra Deva was an era when a great social revolution in Odisha was at its zenith due to the Bhakti movement closely contested between Gaudiya and Utkaliya Vaishnavism school of thoughts. Common man was not untouched by the beautiful literature and devotional ballads that appeared before them composed by great devotees. Due to forced rigorous military campaigns and failed state policy, the military status of medieval Odisha declined during Prataparudra's rule and the empire was eventually reduced to only a small strip of land in eastern India covering parts of coastal and central Odisha, Northern Andhra and parts of southern Bengal. The tributary and Garhjat (princedoms), rebellious generals and hinterland domains within the Odishan realm destabilized the central authority of the Gajapatis in Odisha.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/AHISTORYOFINDIA_201504|title=A HISTORY OF INDIA by Athar Azeem Delhi University|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-203-44345-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/AHISTORYOFINDIA_201504/page/n184 174], 175}}</ref>  As an emperor, Prataparudra Deva utilized his full available military strength to defend the frontiers of his empire but events of internal treachery, ignorant policies against a strategically threat of Muslim Bengal by his father and a possible situation of imbalance of his personal spiritual life with the instant demands from his military command, led to the loss of huge southern territories to his enemies. Prataparudra Deva had 32 sons and many daughters from his multiple wives out of which Padma, Padmalaya, Ila and Mahila are known to be the Maharanis or the main queens. One of his queens called Gauri Devi was the disciple of Jagannatha Dasa from the Panchasakha fold. His successors were murdered by the treacherous Govinda Vidyadhara after his death. The military hegemony and imperial status of Odisha continuing from the past era of [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavanshi]] and [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Gangas]] was lost after his ruling years ended with his death.
