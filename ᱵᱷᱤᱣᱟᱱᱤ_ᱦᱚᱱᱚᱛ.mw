Vol:10, No:9.</ref> Excavations (1968–73 and 1980–86) in the village of [[Mitathal]] in Bhiwani have unearthed evidence of pre-Harappan and Harappan ([[Indus Valley Civilization]]) culture in the area.

According to archaeologists the presence of coins, coin moulds, statues and design of the houses, suggests that a town existed here sometimes in the [[Kushan]], [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and the [[Youdheya Kingdom|Youdheya]] period till 300&nbsp;BC.
