Ravindra N Singh and Dheerendra P Singh, 2016, "A Note on Metallurgy at KhanaK: An Indus Site in Tosham Mining Area, Haryana", World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology International Journal of Environmental, Chemical, Ecological, Geological and Geophysical Engineering. Vol:10, No:9.</ref> Excavations (1968–73 and 1980–86) in the village of [[Mitathal]] in Bhiwani have unearthed evidence of pre-Harappan and Harappan ([[Indus Valley Civilization]]) culture in the area. Near the village of [[Naurangabad, Bhiwani|Naurangabad]], about {{convert|10|km}} east of [[Bhiwani]] city, preliminary diggings in 2001 revealed artifacts including coins, tools, sieves, toys, statues and pots up to 2,500&nbsp;years old. According to archaeologists the presence of coins, coin moulds, statues and design of the houses, suggests that a town existed here sometimes in the [[Kushan]], [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and the [[Youdheya Kingdom|Youdheya]] period till 300&nbsp;BC.

[[Bhiwani]] city is mentioned in the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and has been a prominent centre of commerce since the time of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].
